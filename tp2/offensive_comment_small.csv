37277783752;'Erik, for crying out loud. You legally can have sex with children, but not with underage children. Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a ''child'' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic? The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church. Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic. Your mucking around lost a lot of changes, spelling corrections and other problems solved. I was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job.

12069436201;"'"" Misrepresentation of Eugenie Grandet''s character The intro to this article says the Eugenie inherits her father''s miserliness.  The end of the article states that she continues, as an orphan and widow, to live in his miserly ways, but without his obsession with gold.  This is not correct.The one who inherits the miserliness of Grandet is Charles, his nephew.  Balzac states this explicitly near the end of the book when he says that this trait  """"found an outlet"""" in Charles, rather than his daughter.  Charles, grows from a callow and spoiled young man into a corrupt libertine and finally into a hard-nosed skinflint.Eugenie, whose character is one of modesty, piety, and love, continues to live in the simple and austere manner of her upbringing, but she knows nothing else, and, having been betrayed in love, wants nothing for herself.  In tremendous contrast to her father, she is extremely generous with people, giving Nanon a fine marriage portion, distributing funds far and wide for charity, and endowing public institutions like libraries and hospitals.  Her personal austerity springs from a lack of interest in material comfort, not from miserliness.72.37.171.100  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

As a community, we believe that members who have greater power should use that power to promote consensus and a neutral point of view. When an administrator abuses his or her greater power to promote self interest or personal POV against or without the consent of the community, we believe that member should lose his or her administrative or higher powers. Would you be interested in starting and/or promoting a Wikipedia:No confidence area for the purpose of demoting administrators and above who use their power to push personal POV?In such an area, any editor could call for a show of support or no-confidence for an administrator or higher.

Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that ''expert ~= god'' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.

His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    I added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.    Works for me.

31647100056;Public school controversiesIn France and Belgium, there was a notable controversy at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century on the role of Masons in the establisment of a public school system. The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector. There were also similar issues in Mexico after the signing of the 1917 constitution.;0;0;0;0;0;0

88158361089;Careful here, the stochiometric ratio is independent of air pressure. A locomotive at high altitude would operate at the same steam gauge pressure, and hence produce the same power as at low altitude. I agree that the fire will produce less heat at higher altitude. However, only if the fire was unable to produce enough energy would the power of the steam engine be significantly reduced, but I expect that most fires in steam engines have ample reserve capacity to produce sufficient heat. By way of contrast, a 20% reduction in air pressure presumably would give about a 20% reduction in power in an internal combustion engine, unless super or turbocharged.;0;0;0;0;0;0

We see users such as Kittybrewster admit to it, but nothing happens, because she is supporting the status quo. Canvassing for the status quo=acceptable. Canvassing for a minority position=unacceptable. This, despite the fact that Wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account, unless those views represent an extreme margin. And in this case, Wikipedia may have erred. From BBC to ABC, Cambridge University to UCLA, my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media. Yet I''m being voted off the island by persons such as MLA, who doesn''t know anything about the field and whose main contributions to Wikipedia have bee the creation of MMA articles. And this speaks to the larger ills of society itself, not just Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a tool that reflects society. We still, in the majority, value violence and sports over academic pursuits. Football, soccer, basketball players all make much more than college professors, even the best and brightest in the field. Thus the problem is not just with Wikipedia, but society itself.Finally again, FYO I am more than two, but slightly less than three, standard deviations above the ''average'' IQ, and therefore I see fit to say that I, like Michael C Price, and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society. Even if the average Wikipedian is slightly above societal average, we can still see the groundwork of ''one'' order of magnitude higher. Of course, an established Wikipedian may be well above the average Wikipedia user, so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system, which I see as having quite many flaws.

I have been with people of many religions and found their intellectuals are always secular in research e.g. Jehovah''s witness are very very fundamentalist Christians.  However their research about Islam is very secular as printed in their paper.  Their conclusion is not secular ofcourse.  Then you can read """"Christian Science Monitor"""" which is also a very fundamentalist organization''s paper.  You can not point a finger on their secular research.  Again, their POV appears seperately.  I am a staunch fundamentalist Muslim (fundamentalist meaning sticking to fundamentals as foundation and building over it, not sticking to fundamentals and destroy all construction over it).

How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:West CampusThe West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100''x125''x89''). Its five {{con'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Prástaro in a series of early published works on the geometric theory of PDE''s and the characterization of their global solutions by means of suitable bordism groups.In particular in [1] and [2] it is proved the following theorem.Theorem [Integral h-cobordism in Ricci flow PDE''s]The Ricci flow equation for n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, admits that starting from a n-dimensional sphere S^n, we can dynamically arrive, into a finite time, to any n-dimensional homotopy sphere $M$. When this is realized with a smooth solution, i.e., solution with characteristic flow without singular points, then S^n is diffeomorphic to M. The other homotopy spheres \Sigma^n, that are homeomorphic to S^n only, are reached by means of singular solutions.In particular, for n belonging equal to 1,2,3,4,5,6,  one has also that any smooth n-dimensional homotopy sphere M is diffeomorphic to S^n. In particular, the case n=4, is related to the proof that the smooth Poincaré conjecture is true.';0;0;0;0;0;0

The fact that you can barely find any of his controversial mishaps in his write-up shows an obvious bias in the manner in which Wikipedia has decided to present this article.  Jesse Jackson is a controversial figure, he intends to be controversial. Jesse Jackson is currently one of the most controversial public figures, yet reading this Wikipedia article you would not know why.  There is a problem with that.   I see no logical reason why Wikipedia does not want this information to be known. This article is exemplifies where this site has gone wrong in terms of the original intent of the Wikipedia project.You talk about Wikipedia as if there is one person who wrote this entire article (""""Wikipedia does not want this information to be known""""). Look around. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone. If you don''t like something in the article, you are free to try to make some changes. But one word of caution. Your tone suggests that you may have an agenda against Jackson (and that''s fine), and Wikipedia must be balanced and appropriately weighted according to reality, maintaining a neutral point of view.

72165277440;'(UTC)Shorne, sorry to break it to you, but referring to the Holodomor  and the famines in Russia in general  as a holocaust does not diminish the holocaust against the Jews. Unless, of course, you wish to say that eliminating the social class of peasants is in some way trivial, and hence it would trivialize the killing of the Jews as an ethnic group by association. Calling the holodomor and the related events a holocaust rather puts those events in the right perspective: there WAS both CALLOUS and deliberate killing of the undesired class during the holodomor that was NOT principally ANY different from the shoa. Have a look at Hannah Arendt''s writings and you will see what I mean. However, from your comments regarding the alleged ''bias'' against left-wing pov''s here, I assume that you are in fact somewhat of a Soviet apologist. Since I am myself a social-democrat, I can''t say that there is any kind of bias against left-wing POV''s here. Rather, there seems to be a fortunate tendency towards limiting both right-wing and left-wing extremism. Or, in other words, wikipedia seems to have adopted a cultural most befitting to an open society, and rather hostile towards totalitarian ideas. How fortunate. 05:13, 17 September 2005';0;0;0;0;0;0

Wikipedia will only give a """"balanced view"""" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn''t count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).  Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD:http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.htmlNow, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here:http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdfIn any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being """"wedded"""" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.

So what makes you think that using religion as the primary criterion of nationality is not the closest thing to the truth? Maybe it is, and maybe it isn''t, but neither you nor me are in position to decide that. This is why in my version all criteria used in the demographies are explained in detail, without deciding which is right and which is wrong, and that my friend is what we call neutrality. You might as well try and take a hint. Nothing from the Turkish cencus proves nor implies that those Greeks were not Greek speaking. The majority of Bulgarian population had never been adherent to the Patriarch of Constantinople. You''re confusing yourself with the small Bulgarian or Slavic-speaking population which viewed itself as part of the Roman nation which had lost its mother tongue over time. Therefore despite religion and language, the greater part of the population of Southern Macedonia viewed itself as Greek (or Roman if you prefer). Then if we can''t trust any demography, think of the population exchanges. 50,000 Greeks entered Greek Macedonia from Pirin Macedonia, and some 60,000 Bulgarians left for Bulgaria. Then some 500,000 Greeks enter from Turkey and suddenly, we have some 1 million Greeks in Greek Macedonia? Where did the other half million come from? Mars? Oh, I know, it''s a Bulgarian """"majority"""" group that the Greek government is still hiding isn''t that so? And now think of the ludicrous numbers that you''re trying to pass as the truth: 2 million Bulgars in the entire of Macedonia and the assumption of another million in the south. I mean, use your brain for ones and do the maths - have you ever checked what the population of Bulgaria is today? Honestly some people just can''t take the truth. And if neither of that convinces you then think of the Greco-Serbian alliance. Would the Serbs have ever agreed with Greece occupying over half of Macedonia for itself unless that land was not primarily Greek? Serbia was significantly stronger than Greece and in the search of Slavic-speaking lands to assimilate. It would have never happened. If you really want to do something to help your country, I would advise you to go over there and offer your people some physical help.

68603826244;""", 8 December 2006 (UTC)I’m not disagreeing the fact that Hulk Hogan, let alone anyone, having a belt hanging up on their walls. I believe all the wrestlers have at least a replica of some sorts of all the titles they ever won. I remember seeing John Cena’s, Trish Stratus’s, and Chyna’s homes with a title belt hanging in their respective walls. I also recall Mick Foley mentioning that he has an “Attitude” version of the old WWF title in his closet. In the case with Hogan, he might actually have the real WCW title in his possession. He is only the greatest “Sports Entertainer” ever. I do mean ever!! However, I’m talking about the title, not the belt. I know that “possession is 9/10 of the law"""", but in this case, having the physical belt doesn’t make you a champion. Think about Rhyno and the older version of the ECW title. He has the belt, but Lashley is the Current Champion.  15:56""";0;0;0;0;0;0

66301146425;'As Roland perceptively noted, Sand''s book is not so much propositive of a theory, as deconstructive of theories about a people. The most invaluable part of the book consists of a perfectly normal historian''s history, i.e., of the socio-ideological forces influencing the construction of a modern collective Jewish identity. In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn''t throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it''s just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book. The criterion should be, genetic criticism or evaluation of Sand should be admitted if Sand''s book is specifically targeted or mentioned by those papers, and ignored if not. What should not happen is the application of a double-standard.';0;0;0;0;0;0

I''ll remember that in the future.""""  and added the damn name of the city into the article. That would have been AGF on your part.  But instead you give some flimsy excuse that you are participating in some project as a reason not to do it right.  That is not AGF.

57730561000;'William M Connolley is contradicting himself I am copying this from a section higher up on this same page. | Talk  19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC).Now - on with the explanation. The Coriolis effect is a change-of-coordinates force (and thus bears intriguing similarities with gravity, whether this means anything or not is unclear). When you move from one coordinate system to one that is rotating with respect to the first, then the equations of motion for a particle acquire an extra term: the coriolis term (and one other of second order in omega but we''ll neglect that). So: if you wish to formulate the equations of motion for air on the surface of the earth, it is natural do to it in a coordinate system stationary wrt the earths surface: in that case, you end up with a coriolis force. You could, if you wished, write the equations in a system non-rotating wrt the fixed stars (perhaps ignoring the rotation of the earth round the sun). In this system, there would be no coriolis effect and hence no coriolis force. However there would be a very rapidly moving lower boundary to account for and this would be deeply inconvenient. since the coriolis term is easy to incorporate, there is no particular reason to do this. But... this is only the coordinate system in which you choose to write your equations. It has no effect on the physics, and cyclones continue to rotate no matter which system you describe them in.The coriolis effect is *not physics*: it is kinematics.  19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC).[end of copied section]William M Connolley is simultaneously saying that the coriolis effect is physics, and that it isn''t.An article about the coriolis effect should explain the following:.If (hypotherically speaking) a low pressure area would form on a non-rotating planet, then the air would flow towards the low pressure area and the pressure gradient would very rapidly be leveled.But that is not what is happening on Earth. On Earth, air starts flowing around a low pressure area, amazingly, it tends strongly to flow perpendigular to the pressure gradient, and it can take weeks for a low pressure area to become leveled again  So there must be a physical mechanism that performs a restructuring of the direction of wind flow.  A general coordinate transform transforms the entire picture in one go, if you employ a coordinate transformaton to a rotating coordinate system on, say, a large grid, then the grid will turns around as a whole, with the whole picture remaining in a fixed form.That is not what happens in the atmosphere! If you let go lots of weather balloons in the area of a low pressure area forming, then over time the positions of the balloons in the circling winds will be thoroughly mixed. The more central parts of the system rotate faster.William says that the coriolis effect is to be understood as purely a cosmetic change: a coordinate transformation, that does not alter the physics taking place. But Willam also believes the following:from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley/Coriolis_effectThe Coriolis force plays a strong role in weather patterns, where it affects prevailing winds and the rotation of storms, as well as in the direction of ocean currents. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, friction plays a relatively minor role, as air parcels move mostly parallel to each other. Here, an approximate balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis force exists, causing the geostrophic wind, which is the wind effected by these two forces only, to blow along isobars (along lines of constant geopotential height, to be precise). Thus a northern hemispheric low pressure system rotates in a counterclockwise direction, while northern hemispheric high pressure systems or cyclones on the southern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise manner, as described by Buys-Ballot''s law.This is why I recognize that there are two contexts, that both called ''coriolis effect''. One context is about physical mechanisms, the other is about coordinate transformation.  | Talk';0;0;0;0;0;0

44917702258;'Reply to FyzixFighter FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can''t. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.It doesn''t matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.';0;0;0;0;0;0

53501535734;ReplyTo the best of my knowledge, Scarlett Heights is a semester school  http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/schools/schools/docs/semesteredschools.pdf along with Silverthorn, Thistletown and North Albion.  Weston is not really in the region.   The article implies that students from as far as Rexdale come to Kipling because of its semestered nature.  However, such students would have several closer alternatives.  Something else must be attracting such students.The daily announcements used to be presented on Switch-On on a daily basis. Currently Switch-On is produced only on Thursdays.  The rest of the week, the daily announcements are read by a student over the P.A. system.  The Switch-On program may return to a daily production next year.Varsity Outdoor cricket is the only official TDSB version of the sport.  Indoor cricket is unique to the schools of the former boards of Etobicoke and York.  Since it is not played in all districts, it is not officially sanctioned by the board.  However, you are correct that the local indoor league is divided into JR and SR divisions.I see no problem in stating that a significant number of the school’s students are of Somalian Origin, and that the school has made strong effort to work with and connect with the Somalian community.  However, most of the Somalian students now in the school were born in Canada.  Current refugees are more likely to be from Afghanistan.  The demographic of schools like Kipling quickly changes, therefore it is difficult to keep specific statements like “200 Somalian refugees” current.  Why not leave the article more general to better reflect the mosaic of cultures represented within the school.The YOUCAN program is not an in-house program.  It is run by a private, paid organization.  Originally the program was delivered to small groups of students who showed interest and leadership potential.  Roger Dale introduced the program first to small groups, then to all grades nines, then eventually participation became mandatory for all registered students.  Kipling was the first school to require full participation within this program.  With the apparent, impending requirement for all schools to offer “Character Education” YOUCAN may be positioning itself to become a provider for other TDSB schools.  Perhaps this is why a link was suggested between the introduction of YOUCAN and the drop in the Kipling suspension rate.  However, the prime reason for the drop in suspension rate is that Roger Dale does not believe in the value of suspensions and is a proponent of Progressive Discipline and Restorative Justice as alternatives and prerequisites to suspension. http://www.tdsb.on.ca/pandp/ppdocs/docs/P/P064%20SCH.pdfThe suspension rate for Kipling and its neighbouring academic schools for 2006-2007:  Kipling 2.2 % Martingrove 2.5% Richview 2.8% Scarlett Heights 9.7%. http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/parents/safe_schools/docs/Schools%20by%20Alpha.pdf;0;0;0;0;0;0

It could be reduced to one, or two short sentences that state that there have been and still are historical, cultural and religious practices that involve circumcision - but without going into detail.  This is a medical article, and the use of circumcision as an initiation ritual is a different subject to medical circumcision.

If you remember, on September 4 I sent I sent M.Mario a message for a month of inactivity and ihis status became semi-active. Since then, he has made 2 edits: one on September 30 on Arizona''s page and then yesterday on A change Is Gonna Come yesterday but to become active again he had to make 5 edits over the course of 2 weeks. Despite his 2 edits, he did not make the 5 required and the two he made it didn''t happen in the 2 weeks following the notification, only recently. My question is: am I right to have sent him a new message to notify him his inactivity of 2 months? Or did I have to wait one more week to see if he would have done 3 more edits? Does the user that becomes semi-active have to make the required edits in the 2 weeks following the notification or do we count starting the moment he makes a new edit? Do you understand my questions lol? If I should have waited then I''ll erase my message...Also, I forgot to send Mattom 123 an semi-active user notification on September 28.

43742570150;One of your contributions () is definitely extremely unbalanced und not tolerable, so there is a COI. Without this note, I would believe that this was intentional, but with your note, it seems that you are just missinformed by anti-OSS people like Eduard Bloch... Let me explain in detail: The text in the mentioned diff does not belong into the licensing section at all. It may be a candidate for the critisizm section on the Debian article (to explain problematic behavior of Debian against cdrtools, firefox, ...) after it has been corrected to reflect the truth. The named text tries to belittle cdrtools with false claims, so let me give the correct background information: All CD/DVD/BD drives ever made are SCSI devices. ATAPI is just one of many SCSI transport mechanisms and while ATAPI is fully integrated into the SCSI stack on Solaris x86 since 1993, this was not the case on Linux in 2004. This is a design problem on Linux. Cdrtools is highly portable to ~ 30 different platforms (not counting different CPUs separately) and the man page mentions that it grants equivalent behavior on all supported platforms The vast majority of all platforms do either not have device nodes at all or do not have a 1:1 relation between a specific device node and a specific SCSI device. Win-DOS and Mac OS X both do not have device nodes for SCSI devices, so 99% of all computers in the world cannot use device node based SCSI addressing. 3) and 4) make it obvious that you cannot use device nodes in a portable implementation and that only the official SCSI addressing scheme is portable across platforms. In September 2004 Linus Torvalds introduced a fatal Linux kernel SCSI interface incompatibility while claiming to fix a security bug. This incompatibility was introduced exactly when a new stable cdrtools relase was puiblished after a long time of bug fixing and code freeze in cdrtools. The patches from Debian (Eduard Bloch) that you seem to reference and that have been published in 2004 are full of bugs. In Spring 2005, there have been aprox. 150 unique bug reports against cdrtools  in the bug tracking systems of various Linux distros. Nearly 100 of these bugs have been a result of the patches from Eduard Bloch. The other 50 bugs have been fixed in the original code between September 2004 and August 2006 after Debian stopped updating their source. BTW: As there is no development activities on cdrkit since May 2007, the vast majority of these 150 bugs is still present in the defective and dead fork from Debian. In special, there is no code in the Debian fork that works around the SCSI interface incompatibility mentioned in 6). cdrtools is a really openminded project. Any patch that was send and that follows the quality requirements in the CONTRIBUTING rules has been accepted. The patches from Eduard Bloch did not follow the quality rules. The cdrtools project does not accept patches that harm the code - sorry, but this is needed if you like to give long term support for a program. Note that the first libscg code was written in August 1986 (28 years ago) and that I have other OSS (e.g. star) that is maintained since 32 years.This list of explanations can be found in the internet if you use a search engine...I did write it many times in similar wording in the past after people came up with similar false claims.Please also note that the fork from Debian was started in May 2004 - 10 years ago. When Debian claimed to start their cdrkit fork in late 2006, they did just change the name on my request. So this cdrkit includes all bugs that have been introduced by Debian since early 2004. Cdrkit did never publish a release that has no known bugs at the time of being published, so cdrkit did never raise above alpha-release quality.As your request looks collaborative, I am sure that you understand that you have been fooled by unfriendly people and fully remove the paragraph in question.;0;0;0;0;0;0

78705780344;'ING Mexico''s operations today is largely composed by its acquisition of Seguros Comercial America which was Mexico''s largest insurance company, they are now loosing their number one position to currently number five (huge market loss), as the public deoes not trust them with their insurance needs,this Company was also dominant in the property and casualty markets, until a series of irregularities surfaced and became publicly known, now they are still currently loosing their vast portfolio because of ineptly and negligently handling all of their various insurance claims amongst them the huge the Fertinal claim, which was caused by an insured hurricane loss in 2001, this was a total loss as the Insureds Mine in Baja California was totally destroyed and inundated under water by Hurricane Juliette, the initial estimated loss was in the region of US Dollars 84 million, now it is around the region of 184 million, this for Direct Damage only, additionally they have to add Loss of Profits and now Loss of Market which is valued in the billions of US Dollars!As of the 14th of July 2005 they have been ordered by a mexivcan judge in a court ruling to pay in excess of USD 300 million plus compound interest accrued as of November 2001 to Fertinal (a local prestigiuos mining conglomerate) this because of the repeated refusal to pay a large proceeding claim, which as of May 29th, 2006 has not been paid, of course ING is resorting to all kinds of legal maneuvers in order to avoid paying said incurred claim,additionally the Dutch Management inexcussably and ineptly (and again in a wrong tactical move, wrong as they insult the local Mexican Judiciary by calling them corrupt adding insult to injury) blame it on the supposedly corrupt Mexican Judges instead of blaming it really on their own inept and corrupt local staff once headed by Alfonso Romo (who is currently under criminal investigation by his own shareholders, amongst them and led by his father in law, for alleged money mismanagement in the Savia affair) and his useless and reckless staff! It was about time they honor their due! The quicker they pay their claims the quicker they restitue their social standing and the less the damage will be inflicted upon ING Comercial America in terms of their local image and additionaly in the trust placed upon them by their own Reinsurers who now do doubt their inept handling of both underwriting and claims!!!Unfortunatelly 6,000 mexicans lost their jobs at Fertinal due to ING Comercial Americas refusal to fully pay the incurred loss! These people out of desperation might enter the US illegally, thus adding more strain to the US job markets!

73775699246;'Deletion of AV News page Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.Here is the content:The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.HistoryThe AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.comThe paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.External linksAV News Official WebsiteThe format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they''ve been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.Please info me as to what more I need to include so that our page will be left on site or restore the page.';0;0;0;0;0;0

Admittedly, I am extremely frustrated with user dcandeto, and my actions have been less than perfect, but I wrote an article for a journalism class on a well known guy named Cody Hedman, and Dcandeto hounded on it until it was deleted.  I felt I did not get ample time to discuss the article before it was taken down.  I admit I made several accounts trying to get around dcandeto.  Firstly, I created Cdub1985 a run off of the guy I wrote about, and then jazzy 006, jazzy 007, and I got my friends to try and keep it on.  Honestly, my attacks against dcandeto have been stupid and anger motivated, and attempting to delete his article was an act of frustration but I do not feel he asserted the importance of the writer he wrote about.  Honestly, what I wrote was not a vanity article, and I just thought it would be cool to have an article on wiki but the way I was so quickly attacked and had nothing explained to me was unreasonable and I retaliated.  You know I treated dcandeto bad, but I feel he should be more understanding and helpful towards newcomers instead of trying to delete work ASAP.  Thanks.Jazzy.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Highly insulating oil is used to suppress partial discharges (corona), increase the dielectric strength, and increase the effective permittivity (dielectric constant) of the capacitor dielectric. Oil-filled film capacitors have high energy density in comparison with other types of capacitors used at high voltage, such as ceramic capacitors.

24913453213;"'""However, you could use the same argument to delete almost everything in the article because many encyclopedias include a description of Jimmu so short it doesn''t even cover things like the origins of his name and title and the issue of his historicity. In regards to the consensus of Wikipedia editors, and I''m not referring to Flying Tiger, when Nishidani proposed that in the long run we discuss all aspects of Jimmu''s memory from start to finish, including medieval and Tokugawa times, historiography, and popular culture, most users who commented agreed with that even though it''s safe to say that no encyclopedias cover these last three things. It''s certain that people in Japan made a clear link between Hakko Ichiu and Jimmu and if you had done a less restrictive book search, you would still have found no fewer than 430 English language sources noting this connection, including the reliable sources this article cites like Edwards, Dower, Earhart, Ruoff, and Brownlee. For instance, Emperor Hirohito evidently referred to Jimmu when he said """"It has been the great instruction bequeathed by Our Imperial Foundress (the Sun Goddess) and other Imperial Ancestors that our grand moral obligation should be extended to all directions and the world be unified under one roof."""" As historian James McClain notes """"As every Japanese schoolchild who had read Kokutai no Hongi knew by heart, hakko ichiu meant ''eight cords, one roof'' and first appeared in the eighth-century chronicle Nihon Shoki."""" The association between Jimmu and Hakko Ichiu was extensively cultivated in wartime Japan, most scholars are aware of that, and it is highly relevant for Wikipedia purposes. Concerning our four sentences on Hakko Ichiu, for now I''d say we can shorten it to three if necessary, possibly deleting the sentence cited to Bix, but otherwise I see no reason or consensus to trim it back further than that. Frankly, as the article gradually expands there is even more that can be eventually noted here such as perhaps uchiteshi yamamu, the other wartime phrase attributed to Jimmu, or possibly Okawa Shumei''s establishment of the Jimmu Society. The resurrection of the Jimmu propaganda machine in modern times does not need to be downplayed for fear of """"completely ignorant anti-Japanese POV-pushers"""". Actually, I think we should try to contact Flying Tiger and let him speak here if we''re going to keep on talking about him in those kind of terms.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

63044233310;"'""I understand what you''re saying, but this is not a disciplinary measure, it is further offence as an admin not only attacks my WQA response, but then conceals their attack by turning my behaviour into hyperbole to reduce their guilty. I don''t apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram''s for granted, which is contrary to """"we''re all equals on wiki"""", then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn''t about discipline, at my age I don''t consider """"you can''t login"""" as anything like you suggest, because it''s not like losing wages. It''s the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don''t intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they''ll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I''m sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won''t be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable """"bad faith"""" conclusion.

36827226954;"'"", 16 October 2007 (UTC)________________Removed from """"THEOLOGY"""" portion as it does not fit the title. Please discuss whether this fits under critism or political headings.In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism''s own agenda. Paul''s new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. ''Not everyone who says to me """"Lord, Lord"""", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.'' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff  Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as """"Pauline"""" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter. The small scattered Jewish Jerusalem Church was disbanded in 135 with the banishment of the Jews from the region by the Romans, having been decimated during the Jewish revolt of 66-70AD. 19:10""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

38641414282;"'""Checks and Balances in the Articles for Deletion Nomination ProcessThere needs to be better checks and balances in the process of how articles are currently nominated for deletion, to prevent notable topics from being deleted without actual qualification per Wikipedia article deletion guidelines. This is a significant problem, because it is very likely that notable topics are being injustly deleted. It''s easy to nominate an article for deletion and then type five or six words and wait to see if an article will be deleted, whereas it takes more time to refute nominations. Perhaps there should be more sophisticated criterion to nominate articles for deletion. As it is now, anyone can nominate any article without providing a just rationale for doing so, and can instead simply base the nomination upon basic, generic and inspecific statements such as """"doesn''t pass general notability guidelines"""", while not specifically stating which parts of the guidelines they are supposedly referring to. If nobody comes along to correct an injust or baseless nomination, the article is then deleted based upon unqualified, general statements that don''t actually correspond with the required source searching per WP:BEFORE prior to nominating an article for deletion. This definitely makes it very easy for people to censor Wikipedia, for whatever subjective reasons. Here''s how it''s done: an article is nominated for deletion and an AfD entry is created, a generic rationale is provided to misqualify the deletion without actually checking for reliable sources to establish topic notability. Afterward, if nobody comes along to correct the faulty nomination, the article is deleted. It''s also easy for people to message one-another to delete articles, often per an """"as per nom"""" rationale, while disregarding the actual notability of topics. If nobody comes along and provides an objective analysis to refute the deletion of an article in which the topic is actually notable, nominated per generic statements and without the required source searching prior to nomination, then the article disappears. Hopefully Wikipedia can introduce better checks and balances to prevent this type of easily accomplished, simple censorship. One idea is to include a requirement prior to article nomination for deletion in which the nominator has to state, or check-box on a template, that they''ve performed the required minimum search in Google Books and in the Google News Archive required by WP:BEFORE, and in Google Scholar for academic subjects, as suggested in WP:BEFORE. This would be a simple addition to the AfD nomination process that would add significant integrity to the process, and would also encourage users to follow the proper procedures.Please place responses regarding this matter here on this User talk:Fresheneesz/Don''t Destroy Discussion page below, rather than on my personal talk page.

9681322061;'MUTUAL Intelligibility I''ve seen many people say that they can understand a different language on the discussion page and then list the languages as mutually intelligible. That is just one-sided intelligibility. Intelligibility differs from person to person and also depends on what is being said. For instance, if you''re Russian you may understand a Polish guy completely, but your Russian friend may have no idea what''s going on. And if the Polish guy says something else, you might not understand him at all. It is very hard to study intelligibility because there is so much variation. So just because you understand (or don''t understand) something in a related language it does not mean that is the case for all speakers (or even most speakers) and it definitely does not guarantee it goes the other way around.Mutual intelligibility is not one guy being able to understand something in another language. This is an example of mutual intelligibility:A Polish guy is in the Czech Republic and asks a Czech guy for directions (in Polish). The Czech understands what he is saying and tells him where to go (in Czech). The Polish guy understands and finds where he needs to go.If the Polish guy didn''t understand then it is not mutual intelligibility. And this has to happen for a lot of people, not just those two guys. Alex';0;0;0;0;0;0

50114774054;"'""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn''t going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal''s part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I''m not sure about whether there''s some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I''ll quote it here to save your systems:""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain''s search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.Special effects were to be handled by Moyer''s company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica''s ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""IIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.

28679770574;"'""Actually, my goal is to make a neutral POV present in these articles, which involves removing the biased edits made by you two users. You have both consistently  made very controversial and unfounded edits in this and similar articles based on your own agenda, yet you accuse others of doin the same without acknowledging your own ridiculous POV edits. I am not denying the link between Iberia and the British Isles but it is the same link shared across western and atlantic Europe and there is no special relationship with regards to those two respective regions. The relationship is only based on the Y-chromosome and Mtdna inheritance shared with all Western European regions. It needs to be reminded that there are subgroups to the r1b Y-chromosome marker and the regions have differential values in both y-chromosomes and mtdna. There is very little to no evidence of autosomal and x-chromosome analysis, and when viewing the y-chrom./mtdna percentages in these populations you need to look at them as a whole. R1b is found across western Europe in high frequencies, but it does not mean the populations are necessarily very related to each other. There is no genetic evidence yet of a Neolithic link between the British Isles and Iberia since R1b traces back to a Paleolithic Iberian refuge. The Neolithic and following periods were quite different between the Iberian and the British Isles and the Neolithic Y/chrom. and Mtdna percentage is much larger in Iberia than in Britain or Ireland. You also must not rely so significantly on references by Sykes or Oppenheimer since they have not brought any new genetic evidence to the subject and only cite studies in their books that have already been out for quite some time and are already found cited in these articles. I''ve read through both books and they really do make hasty, unfounded and biased conclusions that do not necessarily coincide with the results of the studies they refer so much to. There are also books already out, and also some to be released in the following months, which  contradict and refute many of the """"findings"""" or """"conclusions"""" of Oppenheimer and Sykes. Their views are also a minority among population geneticists and anthropologists because the majority acknoledge that many more studies on all sections of DNA need to be carried out to fully understand the origins of various peoples, let alone declaring any solid conclusions or findings. I do agree that I should discuss my edits when I make them and I will endeavour to do so from now on so it is easier to compromise on the fidings in this article.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

69822860677;"'""Thank you Joseph2302. I''ll be very sincere with you. I have been a full time article writer, blogger and web content writer. I also earn a living from that. I work on freelancer.com, Elance.com and odesk.com..  Here''s my public profile on freelancer.com   -   https://www.freelancer.com/u/hilumeoka2000.htmlHere''s my public profile on Elance.com  -   https://www.elance.com/s/hilumeoka2000/You can also search """"hilumeoka2000"""" in Odesk to get my details there.Now, I use to see  clients post jobs about """"Write a Wikipedia page""""  or """"Create a Wikipedia page"""" on all the freelancer platforms. In fact, it seems as if everyone wants to be on wikipedia probably because of the high page ranking and traffic that comes from the resource. As a freelancer interested in research, I use to get useful materials from Wikipedia and other sources to write some of my articles.  Indeed, Wikipedia has been a great resource.Sometime in 2002, I created an account on wikipedia to see if I can meet the demands of the clients who request for wiki job on freelance platforms. To be frank, I didn''t understand how to use wikipedia as at then. Hence, I abandoned the urge to write wikipedia articles and continued with my normal web content development and article writing career.Now, sometime in April this year, I decided to start placing bids on wikipedia jobs via freelancer.com.  This is because, wiki jobs are always available but there are few people who actually know how to write them.I made a decision to learn about wikipedia writing and what it entails. I started reading all the wiki tutorials I could see on wikipedia.  I started learning and indeed, it''s quite interesting.  It was not easy initially, but, I vowed to know more.So, I placed my first bid  on freelancer.com. A client wanted me to write on """"Joshua Letcher"""" . I accepted. I used this particular topic to learn some facts about wiki policies.  I created and submitted it for review. It was rejected but I was told what to do to make it acceptable. I took some days to make some researches about """"Joshua Letcher"""" I discovered, there are no media secondary resources.. That was the reason the article was deleted.Now, the same client also contracted me to write about thier company """"Newfield Resources Ltd. I did my research to get some secondary resources. I succeeded and created the article. It was allowed to stay.So, I got excited. I really became very happy that I can now write wikipedia articles. So, I went for more.  I always focused more on maintaining neutrality and using secondary sources. I also follow the rules on referencing and formatting having taken enough time to learn them.Now, as a freelancer, I kept getting alerts about new Wikipedia  creation jobs. I  go ahead to place my bids.  I really got selected by some clients to help them put up a wikipedia page.  I also get paid for doing so as a freelancer. I turn down jobs that do not have media coverage or jobs that are meant to promote or advertise since they are against wiki rules.So far, I''ve created the following pages via the jobs I won through freelancer.com and Elance.com. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Directhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kumar_Kalotee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfield_Resources_Limited https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_Concern_Welfare_Societyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawano_KambeuI made sure each of the pages is  neutral and properly cited. I''m also working on few more pages right now. I don''t get involved in vandalism or supporting stands to make a page stay on wikipedia. My main focus is to create new pages.To be very sincere with you, I''ve never heard about the issue of disclosing paid identity on Wikipedia until now. I thought that I''m free to create articles as a freelancer and get paid.I noticed one thing about most of my clients. They don''t know how to create articles on wikipedia. Some of them have tried but failed. Hence, they look for an expert who will help them.So please, I''ll like to know if I''m contravening wiki rules by creating articles for clients through freelancer.com.  I don''t really know. There are lots of policies on wikipedia. I learn most of them as I create articles. I learn virtually on daily basis. Do I need to declare myself as a Paid editor or something?  Do I need to stop creating articles for clients? I''ll like to get clarifications. Thanks   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

I think this is too specific, as not all proponents argue this. Some (engineers particularly) only claim that the towers were brought down with the help of explosives without any assumptions as to who was involved. The use of explosives doesn''t preclude Al-Qaeda (or anyone else) from hijacking (or otherwise) airliners (or aircraft of similar description) from intentionally crashing into the WTC. It seems fairly obvious that aircraft flew into the buildings, but that also doesn''t preclude the use of explosives. I''m not a die hard truther, but I don''t belive the mainstream media or the US government either. As a structural engineer there does seem to be some quirks in the hypothesis put forward by NIST, and the apparent hasty destruction of material evidence from the disaster does seem very questionable. Calling for further investigation doesn''t seem unreasonable regardless of what actually happened. There seems to be a lot of people who get offended even by the mere suggestion of further investigation (which may in fact help to clear the government of any involvement).

15958982223;"'"" New review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient DNA Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. I''ve been reading university textbooks on human genetics """"for fun"""" since the 1980s, and for even longer I''ve been visiting my state flagship university''s vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that """"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge."""" The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all """"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources"""" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that """"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves."""" Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals. Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genes, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). As more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth''s surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in Africa.

2653406792;"'"", 16 December 2010 (UTC)I''m sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing """"original research"""" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means """"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process"""".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing """"original research"""".  All we can say is """"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.""""  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say """"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.""""  There is still room to debate how reliable """"published author Y"""" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of """"Published author Y"""".  The basic principle here is """"not published => not reliable"""".  And self-published doesn''t count.    18:09""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

49306994606;"'"" novaseminary pov pushing,and section blanking.  So everyone is aware of his pov editing, I have copied some of his history here.  I ask other editors not to restore his versions as they are pov and section blanking.Here is a little histoy on novaseminry. More can easily be found. I include it here to show the type of editor he is. Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman) User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP''s notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP''s subject over several editor''s objections. But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk)  This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) Unfortunately, it''s more than a content issue. It''s a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI """"may be the best first step."""" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk) Fact is, unless admins enforce it, don''t count on it. Otherwise I wouldn''t have had to come here. I''ve suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article. He refused. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk)  I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I''m willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary''s bizarre obsession with this person. I''m going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel  You know what? I''ll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I''ll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk) I''ve never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i''ve come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i''ve done i''ve discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk) Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same. From your comments above that the IP''s edits are the only reason you''ve even been editing the page recently, this should be an acceptable resolution for you too. Right? – Steel  Yes. Novaseminary? I do agree that you have an all-too strong interest in that article. Drmies (talk) 17:16, 13 October'";0;0;0;0;0;0

I don’t know whether he is thinking Wikipedia should be monopolized by the fascist Sri Lankan killers who are some or other way marginalizing the Tamils in Sri Lanka since the independence. He is talking about commonsense. I don’t think so even he has an iota of that.If Anton Balasingham could be named as the chief strategist and the chief negotiator or the apologist of one of the most barbaric terrorist groups, what about the following atrocities against Sri Lankan Tamils since the independence by the Sri Lankan State.           Genocide ''83        TABDisappearances & Extra Judicial Killings       TABRape & Murder of Eelam Tamil Women        TABTorture of Eelam Tamils       TABWar Crimes: Sri Lanka - the Record Speaks....

For what?Here anyone can comment independently and dragging a wikipedian to discuss with some other wikipedians is not acceptable. Then he can come out with his opinions here.Others are also expert in the Sri Lankan Conflict here. ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

42609657686;'Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a ''carry trade'' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.So let''s say the hypothetical ''carry trader'', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.The ''real'' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.The ''real'' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called ''carry trade'' should not have an expectation of profit.Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial ''media'' or even in the ''Economist'' about a so-called profitable ''carry trade'' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable ''carry trade'' defies logic.';0;0;0;0;0;0

An Archaeological Assessment of Portions of the Red River Gorge, Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky.  Archaeological Report No. 1.  Lexington: Ohio Valley Archaeological Research Associates for U.S. Forest Service, 1977.  I have copied extensive amounts of text because no copyright notice is present — it''s a case of .    [page 33] Cowan''s investigations at the Roger''s Shelters (Po-26 and Po-27) and the Haystack Shelter (Po-47A and B) have provided ethnobotanical analyses of materials obtained under more controlled conditions.  Radiocarbon dates from the Roger''s Shelters indicate the site was occupied between the fifth and seventh centuries A.D., and Cowan (1976:97-98) postulates a similar timespan [page 34] for the Haystack Shelter occupation.  Plant food remains from the site include six species of nuts (black walnut, butternut, hickory, chestnut, acorn and hazelnut), four species of fruits (pawpaw, sumac, plum and grape), and four or five possible cultigens (squash or pumpkin, bottle gourd, marsh elder, sunflower, and canary grass).  No corn was recovered.  Fragments of cane basketry, prepared bark, and cordage were also collected (Cowan 1976:87-101).[page 36] Cowan conducted limited test excavations at two of the bottomland sites (Po-31 and Po-42) in 1974.  One of these sites (the Martin Site, Po-42) produced roughened surface pootery which is similar to ceramics from the Levisa Fork in the extreme Eastern Mountains (Cowan 1976:73-82)...In 1973, members of the Red River Historical Society and volunteers from the university of Kentucky, Department of Anthropology conducted excavations at Mf-32, a single-component Fort Ancient rockshelter site.  Materials recovered included corn husks, cordage, cut cane, two species of nuts, and shell tempered pottery, in addition to lithic materials.  The depth of the deposit (approximately 10-15 cm) suggested a relatively short-term occupancy (Cowan 1975:101-102).  Unfortunately, the materials from Mf-32 have not yet been analyzed and reported.[page 50] This page notes that Cowan''s 1975 survey, undertaken in response to changes in plans for the reservoir, gained stratigraphic information on a multicomponent Archaic site (Po-17) in the valley.  Cowan returned the following year to complete testing at Po-17 and Po-42, and to initiate excavation at Po-47B, a Woodland rockshelter site.  The data recovered from Po-17 confirmed Cowan''s 1973 stratigraphic sequence and provided valuable information on the transition between the Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultures in [page 51] the Red River valley (Cowan 1976:ii).  Excavations at the Haystack Shelter (Po-47B), a Late Woodland dry shelter site, uncovered a large quantity of well-preserved organic remains.  Split cane basketry fragments, plant fiber cordage, leather, quids, paleofeces, and numerous plant food remains including both native and exotic cultigens were among the specimens recovered';0;0;0;0;0;0

69317147741;"'"" JIDF posts image for Wikipedia Here''s a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blog specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads """"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia)."""" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF''s self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I''m sorry if you''ve already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes,  | Talk I don''t like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)  Hm. That''s interesting.  The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn''t display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance.  Maybe we should drop that image.      It looks like the JIDF doesn''t want to be on Wikipedia after all. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I''m assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I''d be interested in hearing the pro''s and con''s for keeping the image. (Aside from the promotional concern I''ve floated above.) Tx,  | Talk I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas logo is subject to copyright. I''ve brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don''t have screenshots. They don''t even have pictures other than the logo, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events.  The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page.  Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their info box. LinkedIn just has a logo.  Myspace has a logo and a picture of the headquarters building. None of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn''t usually do that.    But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group''s activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the targeted group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean?  | Talk Just to clarify, there was already a sample up.  I read the blog and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

It''s almost impossible to rationally justify such a reckless suggestion. The proposal to restore the old version is also very puzzling in light of the fact that it was a hopeless quagmire, as people repeatedly documented.

Discussion is here .   Speedy deletion of Bivattchee A tag has been placed on Bivattchee requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a band, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject''s importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for musical topics. If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article''s talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don''t hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia''s policies and guidelines. -  (Talk to me)   TTN This comment was completely unacceptable.

Yes, there are relevant qualms about calling it a """"mosque"""" since that''s not all the planned center would be, but there would be facilities for holding prayers and services, and really the distinction between mosque and prayer room in this sense is a semantic distinction.  If there were a line in the first paragraph of the lead qualifying that it''s not solely a mosque project and perhaps even the word """"mosque"""" isn''t strictly correct, I''m okay with the use of that word in the title.

If you travel by train or air, you must have an ID with you - but in the USA, you also need an ID to travel by air, do not you? The police have the right to request your ID only if you are a crime suspect. I believe this is the same in the USA, isn''t it? The problem is that this right is easy to abuse. In Russia, especially in bigger cities, policemen can claim you resemble someone wanted, and place you in custody until your identity is determined (but not longer than for some time which I do not remember now). They would release you from custody for a small amount of money unofficially paid to them. The problem is thus not in the law, but in the improper conduct of policemen.

How on earth can First Departure be a direct port of Star Ocean when it has the Star Ocean 2 battle engine?

I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical"""", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That''s not what I meant.    As far as the """"theological reasons"""" the point too is why would they be so """"vested"""" if they didn''t believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?

And also, if it was """"587"""" instead of """"607"""" (according to the whole """"2520 years"""" view, which I know you don''t believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we''d still be living in the """"last days"""" anyway.

You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole """"Gentile Times"""" thing (as you know of course) for the whole """"Messiah''s Kingdom"""" breaking in for the """"end times"""" etc etc.    It''s whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn''t, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".   There''s no real difference between the word """"beginning"""" and """"start of"""".    THAT''S THE POINT.     It says """"I am starting off"""".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God """"already started off"""".   So?    Because in all versions the word """"already"""" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I''m a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it''s """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn''t that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say """"I am beginning with you"""" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?

41462230229;"'"" Pathetic Motorways, and the """"Walton Summit Motorway"""" I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a """"Wacky Website"""", but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of """"unsigned"""" motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the """"parent"""" motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short """"spur"""" motorway actually links two different motorways.If it is part of the M65, as the """"start of restrictions"""" sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state """"M61 (M65)"""", meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.  A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the """"start of restrictions"""" sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states """"A57(M)"""", but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it''s the """"Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995"""" that you''re looking for if you''re really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a """"C"""", """"D"""" or """"U"""" classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

44827545165;"'""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  I''m sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in ''spurious arguments''. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia''s displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can''t be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don''t seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank ''I know more about Wiki than you'' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

Think of all the children that enter Wikipedia and see this revisionist history and will need deprogramming in the future. I commend our maintsream admins. I support the neutrality and common non-OR sense of our admins.

Grow up.   National stubs Hi there,Just a small suggestion: When you stubsort (such as you did in the article Hinduism in Tanzania), please include the national stub (Tanzania-stub in this case). Good work otherwise. Thanks Religious ArticlesYou''ve tagged a lot of religious articles, particularly, but not limited to Catholic articles, for lack of notability. Some of these might have been taken from the Catholic Encyclopedia. What do you expect for reference material? Explanation of religious organization is fairly basic to society. The articles could be much better referenced, I suppose. Do you have a good example someplace of what you are looking for? For example, you have tagged the first Catholic diocese in the US, Baltimore, for lacking notability. Are you just tagging American dioceses? I am interested in your thoughts here. Are you looking for lots of footnotes? External references?  Thanks. The Jesus Christ article can have'";0;0;0;0;0;0

76256646538;I am so sorry!  For a man (or woman) of your intellectual capacity and learning, to have to put up with such unintelligent discourse, must tax your patience to the maximum.  Sometimes I wonder what inner strength drives you, what altruistic motive there must be within you, to come here year after year, post after post, and not answer questions, and avoid discussions about your sources of your magnificent knowledge.  You know, there ought to be an exception to the sources rule that would allow you to opine based on your own knowledge and experience, rather than the so-called verifiability rule.Perhaps, by next year, we will be able to litigate Wikipedia to allow you to quote yourself.  In the meantime, perhaps you could find it in yourself to allow as how people are stupider than you, they need extra convincing to be led to your light.  It may be slumming, but if you could pitch your argument and your diction to that of your stupid reader, you could find affirmation in your beliefs by winning over all sides with your argument.Until we stupid people can understand what you mean by celebrate, sacrament, mass, ordnance, rite, institution, oblation, peristalsis-we shall labor in the darkness lacking your understanding of this religious jargon.  We should be like the early Christians ignorantly and fecklessly sitting around the table sharing food and honoring Jesus in anticipation of his imminent return without the benefit of the priest telling us who is qualified and who is not qualified to share in a supper befitting to the son of the great god Yahweh-and where would we be then?Cheers!;0;0;0;0;0;0

Once again, France does not belong to the Iberian Peninsula.

5286924267;'First I want to mention that I deeply appreciate your candid, frank, and friendly response.  It is refreshing to meet another Wikipedian who doesn''t see any need to bite someone''s head off just because of a mistake, whatever the size.  Not that most Wikipedians do that, but cordiality is still nice.  Yes, I agree that I should resist the urge to correct other people''s comments.  For me, the ill will is a much bigger factor, especially because I always try to be very careful to never change the meaning of a comment, but it is still a risk, as you say.You''re right, the edits are old and the link eventually gets you there.  These are trivial changes, but I find value in them.  It is true that the servers don''t spend much time on redirects, but I still would like all links going directly to the article they refer to.  Not that that will ever happen to all of WP, or even EN WP, but I can help.  Actually, I started fixing the redirecting links to that particular page because I wanted to make sure there were no double redirects, which would be a problem, and one worth fixing.  Being a perfectionist, I decided to go ahead and fix all the redirecting links instead of just the double redirects (I want a nice, clean Whatlinkshere page, with no indentions ).  A large percentage of the redirects I am fixing are on (main) namespace pages, not on talk pages, and in those cases I also fix the visible spelling of the link when it is wrong, since that should be right.  So I am doing what you were saying about fixing the article pages.  On talk pages (and even in archives), I have been fixing the appearance as well as the link target, but I think I''ll change my policy based on your well-made point: I''m only going to change the link target, nothing about the appearance.  Does that seem reasonable?I am interested in AWB, but I haven''t really looked into it much.  Thanks for the tip.My login problem is a toughie, as far as I can tell.  What happens is this: I click the register/login link at the top right of the page.  I enter my username and password.  It says I have successfully logged in, and even shows my username, etc., in the upper right.  But then, as soon as I switch to another page, I am logged out again.  I have checked my cookies, and I am accepting cookies from all Wikimedia projects that I''m working on.  It is possible it is a firewall problem, but I have no idea how to fix that.  And it isn''t just at the school where I work: I can''t login on computers in cybercafes in the area either.  Maybe they all have the same type of firewall or something, but I never had this problem until around December 2006, which was about the time our school changed its ISP.  I don''t know if that is related, but if that is the case, it seems strange that I can''t even login when I''m off-campus.  A bit of a puzzler, isn''t it?BTW, if you don''t mind me saying so, I noticed that your contribs link in your signature doesn''t go to your contributions page.

60771725132;"'""I just read this article for the first time yesterday and I agree that the language in this article is not encyclopedic in tone. It made me laugh out loud in several places, and it''s probably not supposed to. Even if the sources use this kind of language, it is not considered the best writing practices and can be vastly improved. For example, Why would Nelson''s legitimate children be singled out in a box? Why in the section titled """"Children"""", would the ones sired out of wedlock not be included, as in the one he had with Georgeanne Crewe? Why actually have an entire section on his children? Why not just a paragraph? Or actually, they are mentioned in other places, so why the entire section to emphasize them?  Why is Kris Nelson described as """"making love"""" with Ron Reagan, but Nelson is described as """"cavorting"""" with two LA Rams cheerleaders in the same paragraph? These euphemisms need to be replaced by the simplest term: """"having sex"""". """"She was hell-bent on taking everything she possibly could and leaving Rick ruined."""" Good gracious, this needs a quote from a biographer or something: According to biographer John Q. Gossipmonger... I agree that too much is written about Nelson''s volatile relationships. I don''t see how it has any bearing on his career or notability in performing. Why is it necessary to know that Blair was a cocaine-user, shoplifter, and Nelson''s family disapproved of their relationship? What bearing does this have on how readers should understand why he was notable? I''m not saying the details about his various affairs should be hidden, but the article makes it seem as if, perhaps like Hugh Hefner, Ricky Nelson was *as notable* for his affairs as he was the job that made him famous. Overlooking the article, the same amount of emphasis is placed on his music career as it is placed on his personal life. Actually, somewhat less. I get the impression a relative of Nelson''s has had a hand in writing this article. Perhaps a progeny who was directly involved in some of the court cases among the Nelsons and Harmons. If, in fact, the best reliable sources assert that Nelson''s affairs actually were as important as his performing career, a quote about that statement should come from a very good source. I wrote Roy Orbison''s article, and I understand the issue above about sources writing about the """"juicy"""" parts of the subject''s life. One of the biographies I used was rather determined to place undue and frankly odd emphasis on the writer''s view that Orbison was a hapless underachiever who tripped into fame by accident, and the book is designed to paint him as a mediocre guy in extraordinary circumstances. Orbison''s life was nowhere near as vibrantly sexual as Ricky Nelson''s (an impression that is really backed up in this article), so the biographer slipped in shocking tidbits about other artists, for some reason explaining that only parts of Patsy Cline were found after her airplane accident. So what to do as a Wikipedia editor? Weed out that wtf? in the biography and stick only to the facts.   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

The old ones are great, while the new ones, I''d give an F plus 500 million minuses! I''d be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It''s like all Nick''s staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob''s crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That''s EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn''t watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I''m 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They''re just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who''s into the new SpongeBob doesn''t know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105   Who the hell is editing this article?

In that book there''s a section on relations between these secret Armenians living in Turkey and PKK / Abdullah Öcalan.  Names of some active PKK terrorists of Armenian decent listed as well. Some points in that book are interesting, like joint plans of carving Armenia and Kurdistan out of Turkey, PKK''s increasing terrorist activities in northern east Anatolia towards old Armenian territories, cooperation for Ağrı and Dersim revolts during 20''s and 30''s... Support of Lebanese and Syrian Armenians...I think this aspect of PKK should be added to the article.  Does anybody else has sources on this relationship?   It should be spelt """"orphans"""" not """"orphins."""" I wouldn''t object to having such a section in this article, if the source it comes from is valid, of course.   Armenian- PKK connection is partly a lie. Of course Armenia gives support to PKK but it can only be by funding PKK or by giving them political support in the world arena. Nothing more. Aremian PKK theory was created by people that want to show Kurdish minority innocent. They wanted to say """"Look... Kurdish friends don''t want to kill us, Armenians want to!"""". Sadly, some Turkish citizens believed in such lies. Nationalist MHP party used this propaganda to gain votes of Kurds too.  == ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

As is typical in writings of that era, his history is flowery and wordy and doesn''t give specifics about the research.  He does say that mid-Cardiganshire is """"particularly wealthy in the remains of early Celtic fortifications (source: """"What the Modern Corgi Owes to its Cardigan Ancestors,"""" AKC Gazette, October 1935),"""" and I can only guess that it''s from these remains that the corgi has been dated.

If every envy heart traversing or misleading wrong road of destruction, it''s a little bit unfair, what I want it''s not an explaination, may be there''s no isolation.  So can we own all the knowledge this moment or this life ? You may say it is the greatest treasure but not to hold. All of us have three heads and facing north, east, south and west. There''s nothing, but we still need to face it . You are one of the protector brother, and I know you can feel bad when you get in a bad mood. Never hold it , never trust anybody and please put it down , never ever.  Time will tell . And I hope you can reach my voice of hope someday this life.

Demiurge has decided, apparently by fiat, that my link to a forum on the subject of Bangor is not allowed. He has attemped to explain this as being a commercial site (if it was I think it would be a damn sight better looking!) or a site of my personal creation. This latter is not only reliant on Demiurge''s psychic powers to determine, but is also wrong.I can see no reason to remove the link and leave the council one intact. I would prefer removal of both to removal of either. To leave one side of the story represented and not the other is censorship, no matter what rationalisation Demiurge tries to place on it. There is a great deal of unhappiness in Bangor at the moment about the council''s actions and accountability. It is not material which could be covered in a NPOV entry but I believe it certainly deserves a simple link to enable those people who are interested in the town to see that there is a forum for their grievances.This is all the more important since the local newpaper has been threatened with legal action by officers of the council for even printing the URL which I have linked in. Thus, there is a real freedom of speech issue here. I have not attempted to force this view into the article, part of which I wrote as well as taking and gifting one of the photographs for, but instead simply placed a link in the place put aside for links to Bangor-related sites.I require that some better defence of the removal of that link than Demiurge''s personal opinion be presented.

It seems my judgement that the site is largely based on Nikki''s personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  Her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  Her words are strong, and certainly her POV.  There is no backing with any research to support her point.  The net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  I agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  But not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.

I am not, my political spectrum is centralist, I do not agree with right wing party ideologies. Why would I join one? You are calling me right wing, so you will be waiting a while for your apology, when Ukip are represented in a true light and not by left leaning sources. You will get one. Next you will be telling me all the ex Labour , lib dems etc are right wing, even Reuters call us centre right: http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2011/03/08/ukip-replacing-the-lib-dems-or-taking-on-the-tories/Or that Lord Stodart was once Labour and former councillors that were formerly Labour such as Derrick Huckfield (Staffordshire CC). Ukip are centre right.Once again I will apologise when you with draw the remark that I am right wing, this is asserted by calling my party right wing. (;0;0;0;0;0;0

The reference is making generic statements, so that it specifies """"light nuclei"""" instead of particular elements.  It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.  It DOES specifically state, """"In normal conditions between atoms or molecules, the nuclei never get close enough for fusion to commence"""".  And all of us here know that the conditions of CF are far more normal than stellar.  Regarding the other stuff in my last post, I do know that it is OR and was not trying to get it into the article at this time (it won''t be OR forever).  I just wanted to point out to Art, who brags about his Phd, that he''s the one who is dead wrong about electron shells being in the way.  I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion.  It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion.  It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here.  IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems?  Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?  The SUN does not fly apart, all its temperature-freed nuclei receding to infinite distance under the influence of mutual electric repulsion (which would indeed happen if there were no electrons in the mix).

58070567860;'Brews, the rotating identical spheres makes a good action-reaction pair example. We''ll begin with the general radial equation as it applies to sphere A,Applied centripetal force + induced centrifugal force = mwere r is the radius. Since the string joining the spheres is not changing in length, then m will be equal to zero and so the centrifugal force outwards on sphere A will be equal to the centripetal force inwards on sphere A, which is given by tension T. Hence T = mv^2/r which equals both the centrifugal force and the centripetal force.Every force acting on sphere A will have an equal and opposite force acting on sphere B. Hence the centripetal force (-T) acting on sphere B could be considered as a reactive centrifugal force from the perspective of sphere A.This example is OK, but because it is circular, it masks the general picture. If you were to choose an elliptical example, that would eliminate some of the equalities and also eliminate any confusion that might ensue from those equalities.That''s why I favour a more complicated example such as a Keplerian orbit.';0;0;0;0;0;0

Perhaps the output would be more readable if it was slightly rearranged. Currently the output looks to me almost machine readable! First, most people are interested only in certain subjects on Wikipedia, so in my opinion it would be best to start with the article in question. The exact time parameter seems almost redundant as the entries keep coming so often. At least, maybe it could be hidden somehow or be output last in a small font? Perhaps also add headlines so people could just scan the table of contents for their favorite articles?

7107177232;', 25 April 2009 (UTC) Here is a little something that I came up with myselfLet the boxes equal the letters A-VLet the prize that you want to win be behind box A (It doesn''t matter which box the prize you want to win is in, [also assume biggest prize])Now if you pick box A, then the probability of getting through to the end of the game with the prize you want still in the game is 1(certain).This occurs is (1/22) cases.(1)*(1/22)=(1/22)If you don''t pick box A then the probability of you getting to the end of the game without taking out the prize you want is:(20/21)*(19/20)*(18/19)... *(2/3). This can be re-written as:(2*((20!)*(1!)))/(21!).There is one very important thing to note here. In the sum, you don''t multiply by 1/2, because you don''t need to eliminate all of the boxes, just all but one (plus yours). This means that instead of dividing by (21!), you must divide by (21!)/(2) which is why there is a 2* on the top.The sum works out with a value of (2/21) = 0.9523809524This occurs is 21/22 cases so:(21/22)*(2/21)= (1/11)Therefore, you are twice as likely to be on the path where you didn''t pick the prize you wanted (i.e. grand) first, which means that you should swap. Now there may be a flaw in my logic, and if there is then please point it out.82.26.43.91  15:46';0;0;0;0;0;0

82915511212;'UPittIT Block Hi Orangemike,Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor''s responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor''s lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor''s user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can''t be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor''s additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated). Thank you.';0;0;0;0;0;0

44817223602;'Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It''s hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders'' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel''s website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. Dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.';0;0;0;0;0;0

This section''s rationale is clearly flawed in that it confuses the word """"conservative"""" with the meaning of """"cautious"""", which is obviously what a preliminary scientific statement must be (and is accordingly described as such by all sources) with the politically-charged word """"conservative"""". Just because a scientist is eventually overcautious and may understate his predictions so that they are not hijacked by scaremongers and susceptible laymen (including journalists), it doesn''t mean that he is, politically speaking, a """"conservative"""" or just too business-friendly. It means he is doing his job well and responsibly, that is, with caution.

Somebody just puts someone has a son named David and voila, this David formed the Davidson''s, but another brother formed the Cummings?? This makes no sense at all. If you did reach out to Clan Davidson, that was a wise thing to do. Who they say they descend from carries much more weight than others who might have an interest in slandering their name.

I only wish I could call it your society).  But I may call Wikipedia your propaganda tool, since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased.  If you really want to avoid bias, just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend Horrorshow, who, not surprisingly, has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry.  Wikipedia: a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people''s opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health?  Quite a question to ponder.  But my point on bias is that every author is biased.  Just because Wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody (in theory it can be, but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well-organized individuals who have made Wikipediaing their vocations), does not make Wikipedia an unbiased source of information.  The author of this webpage, who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the United States, is biased.  His or her comments on Lubben''s religious views clearly betray that sentiment, as do the history of his or her activities on Wikipedia.

Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine. They were, I suggest, intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys. To me, to call them """"battleships"""" is confusing - they were not the equal of the """"Bismarcks"""" nor even of the """"KG5s"""". They certainly had the capability to be upgraded to """"proper"""" battleships, it was a design feature and, I think, work did start on the Gneisenau. I accept that the German term """"Schlachtkreuzer"""" translates directly into """"battleship"""", so what? This is the English language Wiki and should convey meaning to English speakers. """"Battlecruisers"""" were at a disadvantage to """"battleships"""": see Hood and Scharnhorst - and to me, that''s the point. Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it''s a language issue. After all the Graf Spee, Scheer and Lutzow/ Deutschland have had differing descriptions in English (""""pocket battleship"""" or """"heavy cruiser"""") and German (""""panzerschiff"""").I had thought that the accepted way forward was to explain the differing views, when appropriate.Lastly, I object to the insinuation (perhaps not a serious one) that, because expert(?) comments on one side of the debate are not right here, the debates that have been carried on elsewhere (above, below and elsewhere) can be ignored.

51586232814;"'"" Not impressed by the generic explanation when you removed my link twice. Walter, I see that you are a fellow Christian and a fellow Christian musician, although being 12 years younger than I, it''s not likely that you lived through the early days of the """"Jesus Movement"""" as I did.  As a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time """"Jesus Musician,"""" I''ve recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site''s expenses, you''d be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site''s manifold expenses as a """"write-off"""" from my professional consulting business.)  Because I grew up with people who hate Contemporary Christian music (and still run into them from time to time), I thought it would be nice to include articles that show some of the ways in which Biblical living, and Biblical worship through contemporary musical forms tie together.  To find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn''t find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician''s perspective.  So I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals. You might be put off by a couple of paragraphs in first person, but if you''ve ever read Paul Baker''s books, you''ll find all the proof you need that it''s an accurate history, even to the minor details.Or maybe you''re put off by some of the """"negative"""" statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.  But the sources you cite and books you recommend have sections that are FAR more negative.  Also, I carefully chose details that would get the point across with inspiring the reader to outrage on certain topics, as a fully-detailed account would have done.I''ve also """"vetted"""" the article for content, balance, and tone by running it past former touring artists and Christian broadcasting professionals who lived through the same era. I have gotten nothing but enthusiastic response.  If you can find another Internet-published article (or ten) on the same subject that is as well written, organized, balanced, and fact-based as my article, please let me know.  I''d be VERY glad to link to them from my web site.  I''d also like to know why you don''t link to those articles from the Wiki article?  If they exist, that is.Finally, I confess that I am at a loss as to why you consider my article either to be a """"commercial advertisement"""" or a """"personal blog"""" (both accusations came through the message to me, though it was largely """"boilerplate,"""" so I''m not sure which part was really yours).  I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.Also, the article dos NOT contain unverifiable personal ramblings or rants, as a blog would.  (I publish blogs in other web sites so I know the difference.) Perhaps you object to the fact that I posted the link myself.  Would it be a better article if I asked an industry contact to post the link?  Or maybe you should read the article yourself and let me know specifically what you feel is unsuitable about it?If you''ve lost the link, it''s at:  http://www.schooloftherock.com/html/a_brief_history_of_contemporar.htmlFrankly, I''m hoping that as a fellow musician you find the article edifying, exhorting, and comforting.  And if you ARE aware of anything """"wrong"""" with it on any level, please let me know, because I strive for proessionalism.Sorry for the VERY long comment, and God bless, Paul Race [[Special:Contributions/198.134.2.62|198'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Sloan was never found to be an unfit parent or a danger to his daughter.  The essential ingredient in the termination of Sloan''s parental righs was U.S. dollars.Shemema was returned to the USA because the couple (who were private US citizens) had the money to pay and agent to get Shemema back. That US couple wanted to raise Shamema as a Christian, which Sloan did not want.  No gov''t agencies of any sort were involved in that action. Sloan''s wife as the time had been coerced by the paid agents. The coersion by their agent included implied threats against the health and safety of that woman''s own children, but those threats occurred outside of US territory.During Sloan''s time as a fugitive, the gov''t of the USA had custody of him multiple times and chose not to extradict him back to Virginia simply because of the expense involved.  Sloan was a fugitive in name only and only because one Viriginia judge was annoyed at him and he the authority to make him a fugitive rather than just let Shemama''s natural parent raise her as he saw fit.I am asking for balance in the presentation of this story. It is not as simple as the text currently suggests and the implications, as the the text currently stands, that Sloan was simply just another irresponsible, unfit parent.  Please review the facts and ensure that the text reflects the real ambiguities of the situation. We are not here to re-determine the best interests of Shamema: we are here to report the Truth w/o any implied defamation of Sloan''s character.

41540721870;"'""Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn''t the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent, even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions. Talk ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0
4439809157;"""::I would say that the process of """"lumping"""" and """"splitting"""" is intimately connected to phylogenetics (not to cladistics) by the fact that reality is ambiguous, both in a momentary and in a historical perspective. This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]""";0;0;0;0;0;0

95286368389;'You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell.- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn''t - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.It''s indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It''s all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you''re just a wannabe. Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I''m truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.It''s kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I''m not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I''m sure there''s a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.And too bad you didn''t quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.Good riddance!!';0;0;1;0;0;0

79545986562;Comment on Implementations There is 3rd common way of implementing deques and that is as an array of pointers to fixed sized pages of the elements (usually a power of 2, even 1 element) The advantage of this scheme is that if new elements are inserted at the front or end of the deque, pages containing elements in the middle of the deque need not be disturbed. Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end. An array implementation would fail when the array needs to be reallocated.;0;0;0;0;0;0

The Chelsea Academy has in fact been modeled on the Ajax academy, and has been implemented by Piet de Visser and Henk ten Cate (well until Grant was fired). The Barcelona academy was totally based on the Ajax Academy and was implemented when Cruyff was manager there. These are historical facts and it''s not like I''m some kind of marketing executive from Dubai trying to say that Manchester City has the best academy ever. Incidentally, the Ajax Academy in it''s current form was originally set up by Rinus Michels, who is credited with the invention of a major football tactic known as """"Total Football"""" (as played by Ajax, Barcelona, and Arsenal today) and was named """"coach of the century"""" by FIFA in 1999.

68992338261;"'"" Please help regarding diacritics in Indian mythological names Can you please help me regarding the use of diacritics in Indian mythological names used in articles? I am trying to find a policy page (if it exists) on the usage of names that have diacritics in other articles. Some articles include the diacritic information when   non-English words are used while others don''t mention them. This sometimes leads to incorrect pronunciation. For eg: in this article Vishvamitra, """"Puthrakameshti"""" is mentioned in the section """"Kaushika"""". In """"Puthrakameshti"""" the first """"a"""" is short while the second """"a"""" is long thereby requiring a diacritic. As you can see, the diacritic is not used in any part of this article. But in this article Valmiki it is used, """"kāṇḍas"""". Do you know if a policy page exists on this? What is a nice balance between making it simple and following proper pronunciation? If I include diacritics on every previously unspecified non-English (in this case, mainly Sanskrit) word it would become difficult to read the article. The other extreme is also not very desirable.Thanks a lot. ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

That doesn''t seem very binding.Third, I don''t remember being in a discussion last week where the """"European pattern of disambiguating by comma"""" argument was used.

10268324439;"'""Read very closely .Per WP:VERIFY and WP:BURDEN, the burden of proof that the image shows Godane has already been proven through the many, upon many reliable and reputable sources. You seem to have an issue with this, therefore the onus has now been transferred to you in order to prove to the contrary, something which you have so far failed to do. None of the sources you have cited have explicitly denied the authenticity of the image. They have merely used a different image of Godane. This does not support your contention that the image which is being discussed here, which is used by sources more reliable and reputable (e.g United States State Department , BBC and Reuters, among others) against the sources which you have cited, of which I have not heard of any one of them ( ''Suna times'' and ''Waamo news''). No, there are not """"multiple images on Godane"""", there are only two: The one being discussed here, and the one you consistently regurgitate. Yes, it won''t make the other various portraits vanish. This still dose''t help you, becuase through the above sources, it is seen which image is clearly favored by the more reliable sources. This source here,  is the only thing that you have showed me which highlights that the image may not be Godane. I bet you''re smiling and clapping your hands right now that through this magical source you have proven the image is not Godane, right? WRONG. This source is meager. It is unreliable as it is questionable. The article is a blog, unworthy of proper accreditation, and it''s riddled with spelling errors and grammatical errors, e.g (""""Hammami is still advocating for Robow’s troopss."""") Are you kidding me? The author can''t even spell, and you''re taking this blog over acclaimed sources such as Reuters or the U.S State Department. Wow is all I can say. Furthermore, the blog doesn''t identity which picture is incorrect (If indeed any image is incorrect, the author never cites his source), and the article was published over a year before those media sources cited above circulated the image being discussed here. Moreover, even if the images were used prior, it still doesn''t help, as the author hasn''t established where he got his information from concerning this supposed ''incorrect'' image of Godane. Again, you''re going to have to do more digging than that in order to prove your point.The basis that ''foreign media agencies'' have no credibility on reporting in areas where local media is present is just well, stupid. By that logic, any material/information coming from any part of the world which is not from the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe already excludes many of those sources. This geographical argument is meaningless. Ok then, how about I remove all references to BBC,Reuters, Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, the National Counterterrorism Center (Oh look, they use the image as well! ) and many, many more sources just becuase they are reporting from places where they are not ''based''? Hmm? Seems reasonable logical to me, if we were to follow your logic. What you are forgetting is that each news agency, no matter if its western gets its information from local sources from the places where they are covering a story or reporting from, whether that''s Somalia or Timbuktu. This source for example from BBC  is from the BBC African branch, BBC Africa. They will have reporters, correspondents, sources, all across Africa. And this is only one media source. The Somalian media are going to be no more accurate than BBC Africa , as they will not have the extensive resources that the BBC have, even in Somalia but also elsewhere.And finally, this. """"the various portraits can perhaps go in the body as StantheMan87 suggested """" -. So now you''re willing to compromise? Ahh, I see! So when you find yourself in between an undeniable rock and a hard place when it comes to your POV, you finally are willing to take a compromise that was offered to you by , which you rejected?

We would like to take a more proactive approach to updating this information with current numbers, etc.  We are not sure who was responsible for originally writing the page, and we would like to make edits so that it reads less like a promotional piece/advertisement.We would also like to put the following """"Controvery"""" section up for discussion.  This section was recently posted on the page, and reads unobjectively.  Many of the claims are not reliablity sourced, and the extensiveness of the section was disproportionate relative to both the size of our page and similar sections on competitors'' pages.  We have left three of our majo/significant events on the page, and are including the smaller/unsourced claims here for discussion.  We are open to discussing how best to frame this section so that it reads more objectively.ControversyRaymond James has had been one of the most controversial firms with 49 regulatory events and 61 finalized arbitration''s including housing several ponzi schemes according to Finra.http://brokercheck.finra.org/Support/ReportViewer.aspx In spite of all the controversy that surrounds Raymond James, the firm has been vocal about trying to prevent any increase in regulation of the financial services industry.http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0813601120101108 Some of the most notable controversies have included:In 1997, Charles LeCroy, a Raymond James banker, helped issue bonds in Jefferson County through a noncompetitive process. These bonds ended up funding corrupt activities and led to the county''s bankruptcy.http://46in08.blogspot.com/2009/08/death-of-jefferson-county-alabama-and.htmlIn 2000, NASD regulators censured Raymond James & Associates, Inc. for “yield burning” activities on municipal securities. yield burning involves overcharges by brokerage firms on Treasury securities purchased with proceeds from the sale of municipal bonds. Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txtIn 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms. The minimal amount of due diligence conducted by the firm prevented them from discovering the fraud that was going on. The parent firm later went bankrupt causing millions in losses and one of the biggest fraud cases in the state of South Carolina.http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-02-05-homegold_x.htmIn 2003, Raymond James was found guilty of overcharging investors who made large purchases of mutual funds. There were nearly 160,000 trades that were overcharged and Raymond James had no systems in place to capture these trades.,http://www.txcm.com/reports/Raymond%20James%20mutual%20trading%20scandal.pdfhttp://registeredrep.com/institutions/raymondjames/finance_raymond_james_audits/In 2005, the NASD fined Raymond James $750,000 for violations stemming from a failure to supervise the firm’s fee-based brokerage accounts.In 2007, three ex-Raymond James employees sued, saying they were paid less than men and denied opportunities.http://www.sptimes.com/2007/10/21/Business/Women_claim_sex_bias_.shtmlIn 2008, Jerry Rose was found to be conducting a ponzi scheme using Raymond James as custodian to the assets which amounted to over $16 million.http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2008/06/16/story13.htmlIn 2008, Raymond James received lots of criticism for using obscure provisions under SOX in which they denied whistle-blowing claims on the basis that the claims were made against a subsidiary company.http://whistlersear.wordpress.com/tag/sox-whistleblower/ These laws were reversed when the new Frank Dowd act was put into place on July 21, 2010. Raymond James was mentioned as one of the companies that abused the laws, as a means to conduct ethical and legal grounds. This included the case of John Hughart v. Raymond James in which the complaints regarding lax supervision in compliance was overlooked on the grounds that the employee worked a a subsidiary and therefore had no opportunity for restitution from Raymond James.http://www.oalj.dol.gov/Decisions/ALJ/SOX/2004/HUGHART_JOHN_v_RAYMOND_JAMES_and_AS_200'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when I reinstated the article. Eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war, would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions, and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out. Please check discussion for Admin''s response. I do not question anything said by Manning, however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as Fluri. Also Eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations. Admittedly, I have responded vigorously in discussion, but only to protect the material that had already been checked by Fluri. Anyway it appears that Eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record. This is somewhat surprising given Eleland''s herculean efforts to include material about Israel on the Caterpillar.Inc issue. Clearly Eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under """"Ed O''Loughlin"""" but a bit of an anti-Israel activist himself.

52027632736;What Britannica says about the early populations of the area Macedonia: History – Encyclopaedia BritannicaMacedonia owes its name to the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (or Macedon). Centred in the southern part of the region, (i.e. present-day Northern Greece) this kingdom seems to have been largely Greek-speaking, with Thracian and Illyrian admixtures. By the 4th century bc, it had extended its rule northward into the Balkan Peninsula and throughout the Mediterranean. In the 2nd century bc, Macedonia was made into a Roman province. When the Roman Empire was divided in the 4th century ad into eastern and western halves, Macedonia became part of the eastern half, which became the Byzantine Empire. By this time the population of Macedonia had been largely Christianized. Macedonia’s Greek ethnic composition was overturned by the invasion of Slavic peoples into the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.Paionia (historical region) – Encyclopaedia BritannicaPaeonia,  the land of the Paeonians, originally including the whole Axius (Vardar) River valley and the surrounding areas, in what is now northern Greece, (Republic of) Macedonia, and western Bulgaria. The Paeonians, who were probably of mixed Thraco-Illyrian origin, were weakened by the Persian invasion (490 bc), and those tribes living along the Strymon River (in western Bulgaria) fell under Thracian control. The growth of Macedonia forced the remaining Paeonians northward, and in 358 bc they were defeated by Philip II of Macedonia. The native dynasty, however, continued to be highly respected: about 289 bc, King Audoleon received Athenian citizenship, and his daughter married Pyrrhus, king of Epirus. Under the Romans, Paeonia was included in the second and third districts of the province of Macedonia. By ad 400, however, the Paeonians had lost their identity, and Paeonia was merely a geographic termIt is incorrect to citing Britannica in this article biased, i.e. only the article about the history of the are, which is today Northern Greece, ignoring the article, which points to the history of today R. of Macedonia (Paionia).;0;0;0;0;0;0
94165817974;Hi again, below is the edit I would like to make to the wiki page about me.  Pretty much all of the information is a matter of public record and pretty easily verifiable.  This is the same bio that is used by the university at which I am a professor.  In fact, I think thats how the edit may have gotten tagged as a copyright violation.  Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.

54569375527;"'"" I interpret it as that as we have sources that are conflicting on basic information. While each of the sources appears reliable enough none of them can be reliably, and verifiability, traced back to either reports written by the people involved with the operation or someone that interviewed them. There does seem to be wide agreement that OBL was hit twice with the first shot being somewhere in the chest/trunk (depending on the report), and the second in the head. There are conflicting reports on the number of shooters and the number of shots fired. We have a couple of options for the article. 1) Only report those items that seem to have wide agreement and to be silent on those details where our sources offer conflicting data. 2) Document the conflicting details along with the sources. I''d personally go with #1 as it''ll be a cleaner article. We''d have a constant battle with people trying to inject a POV such as """"OBL was shot twice by one person - look at all these sources."""" I have a personal concern with the New Yorker version of the events in that it mentions the assault team blowing their way through doors and walls. For the first couple of days after the mission it appeared the public was allowed to wander around the compound and were only restricted from the innermost courtyard. Lots of people took photos. I never saw a photo of a hole blown into a wall nor did I see any apparent damage to the doors. Visible evidence of the assault would have been of great interest and no one took a photo? Thus, I''d say the New Yorker and other articles article is wrong on that detail. The assault team likely found the inner doors were unlocked and/or scaled the walls to get into the compound and to move between the walled off sections of the compound. There are other concerns about the New Yorker article in that it switches from great detail which appears to build credibility and the impression that this is an """"inside account"""" to an absence of information on basic things such as what team #1 was doing immediately after they landed. I suspect the entire thing was spun together out of speculative opinions by others. Unfortunately, many of the articles about this incident have similar issues. |talk ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Relies on a GP source.- """"Two activists managed to attach themselves to the platform and attempted to climb despite being blasted with water, whilst another activist was unable to attach themself to the platform."""" Aside from the poor style, the poor construction, and the awkward attempt to make it gender neutral, it reads like the person that wrote the sentence wants the reader to cheer for the GP activists. What does it mean """"to attach oneself to a platform""""? - """"Russian authorities forcibly took control of the Arctic Sunrise, which was boarded from a helicopter by fifteen Federal Security Service officers in balaclavas, armed with guns and knives."""" Is it unusual that the Federal Service would wear balaclavas or arm themselves with guns and knives? Given the task that they were performing, such a uniform seems routine.- """"At the time of the boarding, the Arctic Sunrise was in Russia''s EEZ but not within the safety zone around the oil rig, and permission was not sought to board it from the Arctic Sunrise''s flag state, the Netherlands."""" Does Russia need permission from NL to board a ship that is clearly dedicated to enabling activists to trespass on a Russian oil rig? It''s implied. If it''s true, it should be noted. If not, it should be removed. - """"It is alleged that crew members and activists were punched and kicked during the forced boarding."""" Alleged by whom? Why were they punched and kicked? Were the guards using more than the necessary amount of force to subdue non-cooperative and/or combative arrestees? - The use of the monicker """"Arctic 30"""" implies a sympathetic viewpoint. Just because certain media have used the term, doesn''t mean that WP should also. Just because certain media organizations are sympathetic doesn''t mean WP should be also. It becomes a biased article when it uses such monickers that are intended to create sympathy for those arrested. - Nearly the entire """"Responses"""" section is irrelevant except for the responses and requests from the Gov''t of NL. Seriously, does anyone really consider it WP worthy that a reporter wrote something on Facebook?- The """"Greenpeace Announcements"""" section seems like a thinly veiled medium for advocating GP''s position. Perhaps a """"Russian Government Announcements"""" would balance the article a bit, but the idea of such a section seems silly. - International Reaction section.

Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular ''punch out'' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.

The truth is mixed with false claims from these Bulgarian contributors like """"Laveol"""" - that is the only reason for my actions, and actions of many other contributors from Republic of Macedonia, or Macedonians living abroad.There was a similar dispute for the state of Israel and Palestine.

So, like it or not, comments are going to be subjective, and may well look like """"original research"""".    But it ought to be possible to explain why he thought of this work as a symphony (he deliberately withheld a number from it, because he had a superstition about Ninth Symphonies being terminal: the work we know as his Ninth was in fact his Tenth, and, like Das Lied von der Erde, posthumously premiered).   This article doesn''t address that.   It has been suggested that the six movements can actually be seen as covering the traditional four - movements 3 -5 jointly fulfilling the scherzo function and helping to balance the finale.  (One also quotes the Eighth Symphony''s second movement).  It might be possible to find in the finale a texture resembling a hybrid of scena and aria (two of each, separated by a funeral march, based on elements of the Trinklied which begins the work, in the role of a development section) and sonata.  The last section of the finale with its repeated """"Ewig"""", could also be seen  both as  a cabaletta and the coda to the whole symphonic conception.   So the intellectual and formal weight distribution of the classical symphony is completely reversed.  But we still have something which can be called a symphony, even though nothing more different from its immediate predecessor, the Eighth, could be imagined.   I''m not proposing this as an addition to the article, simply suggesting that it wouldn''t be too hard to find similar thinking in the literature.94.192.68.44    Croy379""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

88388680281;"'"" Capitalisation of waterways features Hi. Can you please point me to the WP:MOS page that says all individual bridges, tunnels, locks, etc must be described in lower case? As far as I am concerned, Basingstoke Canal and Foxton Locks are proper nouns and should be capitalised as such. It is correct to talk about """"the locks at Foxton"""", and """"the canal in Basingstoke"""", but using mixed capitalisation is misleading: Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as ''Foxton''.  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock, unless there was more than one of them: one would write ''the Bath Deep Lock. There is only one """"Bath Deep Lock"""" so """"Bath deep lock"""" is not an appropriate nomenclature, however Bath chair and Bath bun describe generic items and should not be capitalised.Could you please double-check your reference for this format and apply the necessary corrections? Thank you. ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0
96244971928;'It does indeed look very awkward without images but the rules for WP:NFC explicitely state that: The use of non-free media in lists, galleries, discographies, and navigational and user-interface elements is usually unacceptable for failing the test for significance (criterion #8). And right now, I don''t see any possibility of Madlax character list being a special case exempt from it. ( Of course, other anime character lists do this all the time but the fact is: it is against the guidelines. And it may even cost the main article its featured status on which I''ve spent almost year of hard work...Addressing your suggestion, it is indeed possible to just revert the removal of the images but that won''t deal with the source of the problem: the unacceptability of such act under Wikipedia policies, which in turn, stems from the US fair use and copyright laws. Unfortunately, there is very little I can do about the latter, so anyone who''d remove the images again will be formally right AND it will eventually lead to an edit war which is an unconditionally bad development.Don''t think that I don''t understand your concern.

But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an """"Apartheid"""" side bar in the article on Israel or something - it''d be POV, just like it is here.

17331974892;'Well, I guess I was a bit unprepared for the attention the article attracted. It originated as a section in Roman Empire, which is forever being plastered with a nasty-looking complaint banner about its length. Why a comprehensive article about the Roman Empire wouldn''t be one of the longest on Wikipedia is not a question I could answer, but my plan (as I can) is to spin off some of the longer sections into articles such as the one on the languages. I make no claim of comprehensiveness for the languages spinoff. I just tried to hit the major languages and regions. I believe Armenian is mentioned once in the Christian section. In general, I don''t have a good feel for the Danubian provinces and the Balkans, so that was about the last thing I added, and almost forgot to.

It may be that there is some more information which could usefully be added to the article about the church, sourced to the book (as far as I  know the book would qualify as a """"Reliable source""""). The article at present is entirely about the architecture of the building, not the history of the church as an organisation. In adding anything, remember to write in your own words and not copy the text of the book, which would be a breach of copyright.

Gustafson should provide an explanation that is actually an explanation and not a sarcastic put-down. (On the talk page he wrote """"We are an encyclopedia. I''ve linked the word for people who seem to forget what that is,"""" which surpasses any of my comments in everything but cleverness.)The """"indiscriminate collection of information"""" section of WP:NOT does not explicitly cover the issue, as Jeffrey O. Gustafson seems to believe, and I believe there is definitely room for some POV. Again, this could have been settled in a debate, but Jeffrey O. Gustafson was just too good for that.

It is too bad because both Mr. Garner and Ms. Chenoweth are proud of their heritage and aren''t using it to gain more fame.  Mr. Garner in fact is involved in many causes to publicize the history and the needs of the Cherokee people.  Neither are Johnny Depp, Kevin Costner, and several others using their ancestry to bring attention to themselves.  There are those who fake their ancestry to get attention, but none of the people I named people have a reason to do so.

13007475026;"'"" The main things I disagree about the Haunted Castle post... """"No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.""""This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I''ve seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn''t spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I''ve never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn''t time to think that they were """"mannequins"""".    """"Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor''s Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle''s entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.""""Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy''s parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn''t go after him.""""According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.""""Although its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.I think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill-fated group, the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property, as well as numerous other facts.Thanks!````""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

I always try to check before I create a new article that it hasn''t been done before, but googling the site first (and also double-checking in the categories) seems to be the best way to do it. The good news is you could easily merge your list into the pre-existing ones and raise their quality. By keeping the lists focused on one topic, it would also be possible to illustrate every single insignia (so long as there is a photo on Wikipedia or Commons somewhere). Like I said, the list you produced was fundamentally of """"featurable"""" quality (possibly with a little bit of work, but not much) and there are plenty of lists on Wikipedia that are of very low quality yet are inherently featurable if they got a little bit of TLC. You seem to have the skills to do that... so if you want to do some """"rescue"""" missions, there''s definitely a job there for you with a rather nice reward at the end. Try not to be too dismayed!

DYK''s approach is and always has been that if content meets the requirements, it gets accepted. Also, it''s not as if a surplus of articles in a particular topic area are holding up other articles appearing in DYK. As I said, it has a fairly high throughput in any case and even a large number of articles on a single topic - I mentioned 300 Indonesia articles in the course of a year - gets lost in the total number of articles that appear in the slot.   20:39""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Never when you did obvious mistakes like placing a tag including edit warring(which was ridiculous) had you admited your mistakes. What I am saying is that what you placed as last warning does not qualify by any standard as warning material. As well, placing a block for incivility directed at your person isen''t the right thing to do, usually an experienced administrator leave this sort of thing being settled by another administrator. I admit, """"he started it"""" is not an excuse, but neither is claiming that you only warn when you see things, you seem to have a rather selective sight here.

Incivity is always the easiest thing for an administrator that does not bother to check the situation, but in comparaison to edit warring POV pushing, intimidations, suckpopetry, threats, it is absolutly nothing.

It seems such events could trigger substantial ''non-spontaneous'' decay that would cause is discontinuity in the typical half-life curve and set dates off by an order of magnitude. Also the level of C-14 in the atmosphere could increase significantly in response to such events too: making a sample appear younger than it really is. No?

51368510657;'Wikipedia is, in fact, the closest thing to a people''s encyclopedia that currently exists, in terms of its popularity. More people read Wikipedia than any other encyclopedia. That doesn''t mean Wikipedia relies on a democratic definition of truth. If we did, we would have to state, as a fact, that God exists, because a majority of the world''s English-speaking people believe that claim to be true. Fortunately for God, he''s still got some gaps to hide in, so for the time being the existence of God is not a scientific question. But anthropogenic global warming certainly is, and this is probably one of the aspects of scientific consensus that stands in greatest contradiction to popular belief. The vast majority of ordinary people display no detectable concern about continuing to burn fossil fuels, and a sizable fraction either deny that burning fossil fuels can possibly influence the climate, or doubt that the influence would be harmful. Wikipedia can certainly report on who believes what. We have a List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming.';0;0;0;0;0;0

37248922943;Is Wikipedia broken? Hi Piotrus,After reading your morsels of wisdom, I have a couple of questions/comments/rants for you. I have seen several times editors leaving WP claiming WP is/was broken beyond repair or something. I think such a claim is fundamentally wrong.The way I see it, Wikipedia is a complex dynamical system, with rather nontrivial internal interactions of a huge number of contributors and bureaucrats.  Moreover, it is probably governed by certain laws under certain assumptions. There is a microscale (individual contributors editing certain articles), a mesoscale (groups of editors pushing their agenda in a group of articles) and a macroscale, the whole project evolving over years. On a microscale nothing matters. You, me can join, can leave Wikipedia, very few would even notice. In a matter of days, may be months names and contributions would be forgotten, the project would however survive. What is interesting to me is that your morsels capture certain dynamics on a mesoscale quite well. And that made me wonder if you can share your thoughts over the future dynamics of the whole project here. Not just some subproject, not just over the next few days, but the whole Wikipedia over years.That brings me to the next question. How can one claim the system of Wikipedia is broken? Do they understand the dynamics of Wikipedia better than me so that they see something that defies/breaks some natural laws? I understand that they joined the project to help it achieve a certain goal (whatever they set in their mind) and after a failure to do so, they leave frustrated. But to claim Wikipedia is broken? Why? What do they see that I do not? To me it is akin to claiming that the nature is broken after seeing that foxes eat rabbits. What do you think about that? (  );0;0;0;0;0;0

Given that the document was published well after the death of the source author (whom it is alleged borrowed from an earlier source anyway) your example isn''t remotely relevant. The chain of authorship isn''t as simplistic as your example. An alternative presentation of plagiarism is the Origin_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#Purported_plagiarism because of the intent of the author but oddly enough the Book_of_Mormon article doesn''t mention """"plagiarism"""" at all. Here it is the reverse with numerous use of wording for """"plagiarism"""" and in the lead paragraphs but yet with no clear idea how the (mostly) anonymous authors would gain from the plagiarism i.e. gain from the reputation of Maurice Joly. The claim of """"plagiarism"""" only works if there is an unearned increment to the plagiarizing author''s reputation that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Now the problem for you is that Serge Nilus did plagiarise the protocols but the protocols themselves are not plagiarised but derivative. If no one claims authorship then where does that leave the claim of plagiarism ? . That''s not clearly proven here so I''m suggesting that the word """"plagiarism"""" is removed from the lead paragraph (though it can stay within the main text and elsewhere that the protocols are used in context of being derivative from the earlier work) as it unbalances the lead. """"hoax"""" and """"literary forgery"""" can obviously stay.   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

2510200747;"'""Are you kidding me? I have been blocked for defending myself against a culprit who has been proven as such in far more ways than is humanly possible to count? Even though the idea of Wikipedia certainly is a genuine one, the way it is conducted is ridiculous. Saying my opinion is NOT an attack, and saying what is TRUE is not an attack but certainly just a way to explain things, as I had done very carefully and thoroughly in my text both now and earlier. I will say it again, no matter how you interpret it. Mario Roering is a culprit with only one single aim in life. He wants to destroy the good name and legacy of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation and its president, Kunihiko Tosa. I am the president of this federation in Denmark and Europe, thus I am the center of Mario Roering''s attacks and defamation. These are facts, and the list of violations not only here on Wikipedia but nearly everywhere else on the Internet is too long to list anywhere. I have tons of evidence in mails, papers, letters, pdf-files, copies of homepages etc. to back it all up. Personally I got fed up a few years ago because of these endless and ridiculous ways, with which the Wikipedia admins/sysops are handling this situation. So at that time I chose to simply leave Wikipedia as it was, and leave the articles the way they were, full of defamation, lies and propaganda, all put in there by Mario Roering. I gave it a few years, then this year I tried again. It is obvious that neither Mario Roering nor the admins/sysops here at Wikipedia has changed at all. It is the exact same situation as a few years ago. Other webservices, homepages, free webhosting etc. which Mario Roering has exploited for supporting his crusade, in the same way he is exploiting Wikipedia, has all deleted and blocked Mario Roering from using their services after a short presentation of the facts and evidence etc. Only Wikipedia is still indulging Mario Roering in his ways and methods with no regard to his true intentions and what he is doing to our organization and/or myself. The way I have been treated here on Wikipedia I would categorize as pure and utter slander, defamation and harassment, in which the admins/sysops take an active part, though this might not be on purpose?!?!? What Mario Roering is and is doing, there can and is no doubt whatsoever. Blocking me, only shows, that fairness, honesty and rules only apply to a very few list of people here. Taking this matter to any official long time instance/institute of Wikipedia, only ads to the fact, that nothing will ever be done about it, as nobody cares. You are protecting a culprit, who has done nothing else than attacking, ridicule, defame, slander etc. the name of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation, our president, Kunihiko Tosa and myself as the president of Europe/Denmark. I have a born right as a human being to say my opinion, present the evidence as they are, and I have a right to free speech. If none of these basic human rights are treasured here at Wikipedia, it only shows, that people like Mario Roering and his methods of breaking the law, copyright violations, defamation, slander and generally lying and deceiving to reach his goals are what is treasured here at Wikipedia. For 5 years, I have spoken out, bringing to attention this man''s lesser morals and lesser ethics, but every time some ignorant admin/sysop run the errands of Mario Roering, as you have done this time, punishing me for defending myself. If Mario Roering would stop his attacks, slander, defamation etc. and if this would be enforced by the sysops/admins here at Wikipedia, this situation would be solved faster than anyone of you can say Christmas. Nobody is trying to stop it, thus, whenever Mario Roering attacks me, I attack back, not every time, but often. Blocking only me, shows only, that fairness does not apply to me, but if justice was to be served, we should both be blocked forever from Wikipedia. As long as nothing is done about Mario Roering, I will continue to do as I have done, and I can assure you, that Mario Roering has, is and always will continue his culprit ways as he has done for the past 5 years. Thus the Wikipedia sysops/admins who are doing nothing to stop it, certainly only put more wood on the fire. There is absolutely no attack intended in these accusations, as they are facts and every time I have mentioned them, I have provided the proof, evidence, links etc. necessary to back up what I have said. Every time Mario Roering opens his """"mouth"""", you all listen and act by blocking me, threatening me or ordering me to take any dispute further using the official channels. When Mario Roering is blocked he only write a short request for having his block removed, and it is granted. Me, I can never do that. Where is the fairness in all of this?

96239976288;"'""Problems with the articleApparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as """"pop icons"""" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.Then there are people whose work wasn''t primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.Now looking at the article, we see a section called """"Notable pop icons"""" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer''s poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by """"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.""""  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of """"pop icon"""" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She''s number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called """"MTV icons"""", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1''s target market, isn''t exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 """"Icons of the Century"""" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1''s chart.There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I''ve already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent """"every side of show business"""", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin'' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as """"Icons of the Century"""".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they''re """"iconic"""" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.Another thing that isn''t addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears'' career has hit an air pocket, and there''s no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it''s premature to describe this relative newcomer as a """"pop icon"""".""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., """"If the Earth were flat, then ..."""")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., """"Because it rained."""").

31250888765;'From Renata3 talk (Let''s leave innocent bystanders alone, discussion moved here)Your campaign for censorship got a strong head start. I dont blame you, as it''s the guy below who is adding fuel to the fire. Friends? ) Think twice when you give weight to what may be insinuations.  With this unappologetic response, I think a longer ban is in order.  Here''s the one vying for head of the censorship department lately. Mind your own business a little more, Irpin.  My dear friend. As it has been ruled by the courts, Freedom of Speech does not extend to protection of ethnic slurs and hate speech whose propagation brought about your ban. Besides, nothing could stop you from using one of your socks. So, you were not really censored. Last but not least, you could take your grievances to your talk page which was not protected. I think Renata was too lenient. But be sure that unless you change your behavior, the next block will be permanent.  Insinuations and wishful thinking. The almighty King Solomon of Wikipedia, almost. I think people have been too lenient in scrutinizing your smear campaign, giving Irpin a sense of some king of megalomania. This is not Renata''s fault, but a consequence of the lack of disciplinary action in your case (long overdue), an institution you so vehemently attack, counting on the ignorant unsuspicion of a few to abuse against other users. Soon, you wont be fooling anyone any longer, Irpin, so watch it (take my good-spirited advice).';0;0;0;0;0;0

Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" Don''t Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn''t find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal''s Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn''t taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I''m not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven''t gone back to doing.Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche''s moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn''t perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I''m tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.

The photographas, are clinical and medical in nature. They are scientifically relevant and in no way should be associated with things like pornography or """"grpahic"""" sexuality that somme cultures consider inappropriate for some audience. Noting that they are Surgical photos makes their content emphatically clear for anyone who might not be emotionally or psychologically mature enough to view them. There are plenty of articles on wikipedia about medical issues, with photographs, that do not include any such warnings, e.g.: Breast_implant/Risks_and_debate Breast_implantIf you took the time to read the entirety of the information Anne Lawrence, MD provides on Dr. Metlzer''s work and techniques, you will see that his origination of his techhniques and procedures are documented there. See also the referenced article by Takta, LL and Meltzer, TR, in pubmed. I believe this article is being held to a ridiculous and unfair standard, that is not representative of the wikipedia. I believe that the microscopic treatment this article has received is evidence of bias against its subject matter, while the simple fact is clear that this surgeon is referenced repeatedly in other wikipedia articles about related surgical topics. In  addition, the very nature of the subject matter should be protected a topic given the level of bigotry, discrimination, and violence including murder against people who receive these medical treatments. The very fact that a surgeon like Toby Meltzer, with such a prestigious medical background, chooses to concentrate on such service to other people, who have few if any equally qualified alternatives, is notable by itself, without need for any further citation. These surgeries are in and of themselves pioneering, and largely non-existent on any measurable scale before the 1960s. Even now, the number of frequent U.S. practitioners is few, including only Meltzer and Marci Bowers, MD (who was previously a patient of Meltzer!), on a truly regular basis.  19:29, 17 September 2006.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

20753804810;"'""No, actually, we''re not here for the same reason.  I don''t have a lot of experience with Wikipedia, and I''m not here to do lots of work on Wikipedia, and I don''t read their policies (would take too much time - not really interested - I''m an armchair reader/editor of Wikipedia).  What I find with Wikipedia these days, is, to find out some detail/meat on a subject, one has to go to the edits and look at stuff that has been deleted.  There seems to be a huge effort by people to delete stuff on subjects they know nothing about.  I just got through going around in circles with a guy (I think he was also a Wikipedia administrator) where he deleted all sorts of stuff from the bio of Anthony Senter (a convicted Lucchese/Gambino mobster doing life for multiple murders).  The whole bio was taken from a well-known book called """"Murder Machine"""" and it was referenced at the bottom under """"References"""", but this guy wanted everything deleted if it didn''t have a citation at the end of each sentence.  I had to tell him that the entire article came from that one book (and it''s a good book, written by a well-known NY crime reporter).  What the guy/administrator should have done is first known the subject matter then edit - that way, he would have known that the whole thing was in fact already referenced at the bottom.  I tried putting in a few links but I couldn''t get them to work (somebody else fixed them).  It''s really too much work to go around and around in circles with these guys (they seem to be """"busybodies"""") as they delete and delete and delete, when in fact the items are either (1) well known to anybody that knows the subject matter (like Conrad''s friendship with Spilotro), or (2) they are very easily found.  The way you are running things here at Wikipedia, the only entries will be made by administrators like yourself who know Wikipedia''s syntax, etc.  You will either not get edits from people like me, or, if you do, they will be deleted.

17865901605;"'"" Rindge article Hi DH,Thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the Rindge, New Hampshire article.  I did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you''ve done has been thoughtful and informative.  As I alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in New Hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it''s because somebody first put in a figure and called it """"2005 Census"""".  Since there is no such thing, I consult the state Office of Energy and Planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (Concord and Peterborough are a few other places where I''ve had to do that.)  I can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but I also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.

I was outraged...I see you have a vast knowledge in the fighting styles of Northern Inda, while I have the same for Southern India. Likewise, you are very knowledgeable about ancient Bharat and its 16 Mahajanapada Republics, while I have the same for ancient Tamilakkam. Since this page on Indian Martial Arts effects us both, maybe together we can combine our knowledges to present a remarkable page. Yes, I do understand our passions which may sometimes clash. However, if we could set aside some of that and work together in a """"give-take"""" mentality we can make things work.At the same time, we will present our contributions which may be opposite of what JFD-Kenny think, but at the same time their views shall be presented as well to give a fair and balanced view on Indian Martial Arts.Do you agree with me on this?

I don''t mind leaving the German """"von"""" or """"zu"""" for princes of territories if the title isn''t used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph''s title as Fürst, which wouldn''t make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Reggae is not mystic music it may be called spiritual - mystic may seem to have the same meaning as spiritual but its loaded with ideas of magic and other such mystic rubbish - palm reading crap.He did not have anything in common with John Lennon especially the nonsense lyrics that Lennon engaged in to insult his sycophantic fans (something Marley never did). And Marley would not say we are bigger than God and that religion will end as Lennon did. Let alone write a song about his mother as Lennon did which sounds like Lennon has issues.Bob Dylan is nothing to do with Bob Marley - if you added him to the Hendrix article then yes because Hendrix was a fan.The quote is typical of magazine publishers. It is designed to serve them. A good example is the recent Rupert Murdoch quote: """"This is the humblest day of my life"""" that led to him receiving a custard pie in the face. It was not his humblest day and he was at the inquiry because there had been a serious breach of civilized behavior from the editors of his publications. Pack it in.

67377649561;"'"" David Johnson (footballer born 1976) Hi mate, it''s odd for me to have to thank you for decimating an article such as you did yesterday to the article on David Johnson (footballer born 1976). Nevertheless, that is what I must do, as I spent most of last night scouring the BBC''s archives (using the Wayback machine a hell of a lot along the way) and rewriting the entire page. I wonder if you might take a look at the state of the article as it is now and perhaps give it a new quality rating on the talk page. I was going to do it myself (it''s probably up to B-class by now), but I don''t feel that''s appropriate after I spent the entire night working on it. Cheers. – Jay So what do you think it needs now to get it up to GA-class? – Jay OK, cheers mate. Thanks for doing the review. – Jay  Stats tables - group stats by club or list them chronologically Hi,as you made this edit at Wikipedia:WikiProject Football/Players, I''m sure you remember the discussion(s) which led to this consensus.

(talk) If you gave this person the chance to add the source, your requirements would be satisfied, as I suggested on my talk page.   It is disgusting attitudes from people like you that put me off Wikipedia. I want to edit and add the references but thanks to your persistent reverts, everything I write gets erased and so I have to revert your own revertions in the way I can then add the references.

66074964838;"'""I was rather intrigued by the addition made by 76.191.230.178, """"that on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""", taken from Quigley''s """"The Case for Palestine"""" (p. 162). Quigley''s book can be viewed on both Google Books and Amazon, where this exact statement appears with a reference to page 216 in Donald Neff''s """"Warriors For Jerusalem"""" (1984). I troubled myself to the library and found the relevant paragraphs. In an episode titled """"June 5: Israel Attacks"""", Neff says the following about president Johnson (top of page 216):""""He also received a message from his friend Arthur Krim. A memorandum to the President that day read: """"Arthur Krim reports that many arms shipments are packed and ready to go to Israel, but are being held up. He thinks it would be most helpful if these could be released.""""Under the message the President had scribbled: """"1,000 rounds of 105mm artillery shells cleared. 2,000 fuses - availability, Gas masks. New Requests: A-4 jet fighter-bombers Hawk antiaircraft missiles.""""Before the day was out, Krim was informed that gas masks had already been dispatched to Israel and he left a message for Johnson expressing his appreciation.""""That''s it. The rest of the page deals with various people he met and communicated with, and has nothing to do with arms shipments of any kind. In short, Quigley''s assertion that """"on June 5th, the United States sent Israel ammunition and jet fighters"""" is unsupported by the evidence he provides. The only thing documented as sent are gas masks. There''s no indication if and when any ammunition had even been dispatched and an Israeli request for jet fighters, possibly made on June 5, somehow becomes jet fighters sent to Israel. In light of this I am deleting the sentence from the article.   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0
10588091223;'(UTC)Things are not this simple. There is much dispute over wheather the US succesfully installed a democracy, since the new government is becoming more and more authoritarian, candidates were banned from recent elections, there have been fraud claims during all 3 elections and many human rights violations have taken place. Also Iraq''s status as a US ally (leave alone major US ally) is questionable, due to the strong ties to Iran of many leading Shi''a and Kurdish figures and the growth increasing influence of Muqtada al-Sadr''s political party. Also the insurgency is far from quelled, although it''s not as deadly as it was around 2006-2007, with at least 4,000 civilians, 900 security forces killed this year it is still one of the most deadly insurgencies on earth.  19:26, 4 January 2011';0;0;0;0;0;0

58748108213;'On  Wikipedia, the best  way  to  be involved with  a discussion like that is to follow all  of it, all of the time. Where these ''perennial'' discussions never lead to progress is because so many  people chip in without knowing what has been previously  discussed - a typical  example is User:Protonk who leaps in with a TLDR speech, but does not offer one single solution then complains at me because I have the decency - and the civility - not to name names, and not to  take his bait. I always have a distrust for admins who can''t keep a civil tongue in  their heads. The real reason, and it''s been confirmed dozens of times, why people won''t run for office (whatever year they  started editing  the Wikipedia),  is because they  are just  not prepared to  go  through  the ordeal that RfA has become.

12629218832;Actually, I think you are betraying a fundamental mis-understanding of human rights and those rights set out in the UDHR.  Human rights are universal, indivisible and inter-related.  I would refer you to the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.  See part I article 5:   5. All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.;0;0;0;0;0;0

31277813065;"'"" anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it. Dictionary it, or delete it?  Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less.  Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction.  The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}.  Both articles discuss the city of Limerick.  We don''t have duplicate articles about the same thing here.  However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as """"Stab City"""" for the reasons stated needs to be checked.  The article, like so many such articles, doesn''t cite any sources.  With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say """"That''s a load of old baloney!  Limerick isn''t known as Stab City at all."""" and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for.  Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite.  Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger.  The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as ''Stab City'' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling ''""""Stab City"""" -Limerick'' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig.  It wasn''t a stub needing work.  It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple.  Both articles are about the city.  I''ve pointed this out several times, now.  I''ve also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one.  You haven''t explained why it is ''clearly'' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. """"Stab City"""" is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The """"Stab City"""" article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don''t have the time or interest to do this.  Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: """"City of Light usually refers to Paris."""" would you put a merge note on Paris too?  If it were as superficially bogus as """"stab city"""" was: Yes, of course.  This process is known as """"asking for the opinions of other editors"""".  It is a useful tool in some circumstances.  Notice that it works.  Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion.   It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice.  I''ve restored it.  The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote """"as superficially bogus as ''stab city'' was"""".  Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute?  Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice.   The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed.  I think this was in the mid 1980s.  I haven''t edited the Stab City article as I''m undecided as to whether it''s worth having.  Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article. I agree, merge it now. I can''t see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article. I think there''s a case for a Crime in Limerick article, but not for one on this piece'";0;0;0;0;0;0

In. and 1124 cu. in. in about 1918 or a later wanted to put the 90 degree crankshaft into the 1124” engine but the Navy and the Army Air Corp wanted air cooled Radials so this left it up to Cadillac to do it in 1923. This is recorded in Manuel Lage’s book about Hispano-Suiza page 66, Line 10. http://www.tecsoc.org/pubs/history/2002/dec2.htmThat design came from a Frenchman with a background in art, Léon-Marie-Joseph-Clement Levavasseur (1863-1922). He started work on his new engine in about 1900. His engine had eight cylinders, but instead of putting them in a straight line, Levavasseur arranged them in the shape of a """"V."""" It was a powerful and compact design, and when he received a French patent on December 2, 1902, Levavasseur became the first person to patent what we now call a V-8 engine.http://www.hubertlathamwindkiller.com/Monoplane.htmThe Antoinette engine was designed and built in France by Léon Levavasseur. Named after the designer''s daughter, it was Europe''s most widely used engine until 1909-1910. The first Antoinette engine dated from about 1901 and was used in a speedboat. By 1905, Levavasseur had produced a water-cooled engine with eight-cylinders arranged in a 90-degree """"V"""" and with direct fuel injection. It was safe, strong, and fairly powerful, generating 50 horsepower (37 kilowatts) and weighing about 110 pounds (50 kilograms). Its power-to-weight ratio was not surpassed for 25 yearsAntoinette VII. Designed by Léon Levavasseur, who was an artist as well as a gifted engineer, the Antoinette range possessed an almost art nouveau sense of elegance. The engine, also named ''Antoinette'', came first, being designed by Levavasseur in 1903 to power motor boats. Both Santos-Dumont and the Voisins used this engine to power their early machines. The motor was of advanced design, utilizing direct fuel injection and evaporative steam cooling - which took place in long tubes fixed along the sides of the fuselage.    M. L.

64498991379;Alison:I like that you started with a clear definition of a Preparator and Art Handler and next described the responsibilities of the role.I would just like to suggest that similar to the roles of Registrar and Collections Manager, in some institutions there may be differences between the roles of Preparator and Art Handler. For example, the last Preparator who worked for me was also responsible for helping prep and customize the storage areas, photographing objects (as part of cataloging) and exhibition installations, and ensuring frames and hanging hardware were in good condition, which may not be typical art handling functions in some types of institutions. As you described I often engaged outside art handlers when I had to move a lot of art quickly, such as when the museum’s board of directors decided to paint the entire museum and gave me only a week to prepare.Another great reference for professional Preparators and Art Handlers is the Preparation, Art Handling, Collections Care Information Network (PACCIN )  ====;0;0;0;0;0;0

95971067146;"'""1. Gene_poole, it is not MY pet project - as stated clearly more than once above. That''s one more proof you don''t read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don''t check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I''m not convinced you can give any actual evidence there''s an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn''t even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my """"little rant"""" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my """"various pronouncements"""" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn''t it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.2. I understand the rules of Wikipedia and its standards for verifiability. But I can name you at least a dozen Wiki entries which don''t have verifiable source either, save some crafted websites linked to them (that''s not a reliable source, anyone can put up a website about anything) - and they still remain. Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was """"made up in school in one day"""" by reading """"my webpage"""". And, aren''t most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn''t this exactly what it''s all about? It''s not about existing micronations.3. """"Wikipedia places a high value on verifiable reliable sources"""" - that''s pretty ridiculous, as far as anyone''s invented micronation is concerned. Invented projects like this do not exist - that''s the main idea of utopia. What a material proof do you require? This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it. My only conclusion: it made you jealous, and abusing the powers that Wikipedia gives you, you did not hesitate for a minute to do what you''ve always done (yes, I''ve been following your epics over here for some time).4. """"Do you have press coverage, books, real-world items proving it''s been an active, well known project?"""" - if you had made the smallest of researches, you''d have found out that this project has participated on a number of exhibitions (the latest one, in Germany) and has picked up some awards among other such invented micronation projects. As for real-world items, the only ones for now are postal stamps issued in recent years - that''s something I doubt most of the projects on this list can pride of.In conclusion, I think this discussion remains pointless until the moment when I provide the above """"proofs and evidence"""" requested. Then, I''ll be looking forward to your response.As for the statement about Wikipedia pronounced in the above Letter, I believe things will change some day here too, though this looks rather unlikely at present. One day, guys like you will be stripped off their undeserved powers. Because the idea behind Wikipedia is too utopian itself - complete freedom brings anarchy. But I admire its democratic principle - everyone has equal rights to express their opinions without being deleted or edited by someone else to whom they don''t sound suitable. As for the Truth, the Facts (what is """"notable"""" enough), the Truth is only what the more powerful present it to be.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

75591112640;"'""My overview1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term """"country"""". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There''s no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. 2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA''s principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.3. Secondary tactical targets: Drug traffickers (this has a """"citation needed"""" mark). I can''t provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as """"anti-repressive"""" or just stated without any explanation. 5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There''s much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa """"traitor provinces"""" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. The last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It''s not clear what erosion may have suffered """"MLNV"""" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. The claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.6. Tactics: I reviewed this part and mostly is ok. There''s the problem of redundancy between tactics and victims and it seems Mountolive had a different approach, that has been partly discussed above.7. Government response: the treatment of unionist paramilitary groups is too focused on the GAL ignoring once important GCE and BVE) and I''d like to see some material on the following:Dispersion of ETA prisioners, history of it and its effects on militant prisioners and their relatives and friends (at least a mention to all those dead in car accidents while travelling to visit their imprisioned relatives). Recent legal and judicial steps on practical life termsGeneral replacement of Spanish police corps by Basque Ertzantza (in the BAC) and its influence.The rest is ok, I think, though maybe the 18/98 procedure and the derivated ones need an article for themselves. I''d like also more info on the closed newspapers, radios and magazines, tortures to journalists of Egunkaria ([http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10179 reporters sans frontiers 2004 report). I think you can retire """"controversial"""" from Garzón - though I insist that he''s actually quite controversial in fact, I admit it may break WP:NPOV.8.

15540485930;"'"" District of Safed Hi, regarding your edit at Dallata.  Because there are quite a few examples of more than one village in Palestine of the same name, we usually identify which district of Palestine it was in (sometimes even in the article name). The unwritten convention among the editors who work on the village articles is to use the 1945-8 districts since that is what most modern sources use.  See Districts of the British Mandate of Palestine, last section, where you will notice that we should be calling them """"sub-districts"""" rather than """"districts"""".  Also, writing that a village was in Mandatory Palestine won''t do, since that entity only lasted about 25 years but most of the villages were there for centuries.  Saying that they were in Palestine would be more accurate.  It can be confusing, but I think """"Palestine"""" along with the past tense is about the best short solution.

87186445465;'Hi. We have three members already. We all seem interested in the project. I have created a template to place on article''s talk pages. An user from the Spanish WikiProject has just suggested that we translate articles from one Wikipedia to the other using an automatic translator, but no-one responded yet. One of the members is interested in writing about gay literature, and there has been somewhat of a discussion about whether it should be gay literature or LGBT literature. I believe this was the first discussion of the project. Two of us think that LGBT literature would be best. I don''t have a lot of time to dedicate to the project, so I would like it if it didn''t depend on me to survive and grow and be successful. The other two members have asked what they can do for the project. I would like to write something to better explain what a Wiki Project is for, because this seems unclear. I believe it''s not much of a big deal, it''s just a way to have all people interested in the same subject in the same place, so if something important happens concerning that subject (for example a page gets nominated for deletion), all interested people get to know. It should also create a sense of community, and it''s good to have that since we''ll be editing the same articles.

Go away, please.I know, you want me to hold the burden of proof.  Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.

While Anonymous does profit from Anonymity, and 4chan users can profit from anonymity, I think there needs to be a more direct connection shown in this article before there needs to be an extended section upon 4chan within the article.

I think most of their era was spend in India, I remember Karturaghti''s mentioning that Ghurids were not Farsi and that their offspring hated Farsi as well and did not wanted to be spoken in their courts. With all respect to Iranian dominated wikipedian but we have to admit that Pashtuns or Afghans are really disrespected in this matter specially in their So called true and first pashtun dynasty. Many of our sources point out that Pathans were the owners of Ghurid kingdom and in fact if someone looks at the word Pathan they will see the picture clearly of how it came to be noticed by indians as first muslim """"invaders"""". Also talk The Iranica''s is too vague if Šansabānī family were persian Sassanian/middle persian and it comes the word from the name """" Wišnasp"""" and who was  Wišnasp, what or who was  Wišnasp? Iranians and indians always exchange names such as Iraj should we claim Iraj to be an indian just because its an indian name drived Raj?  Wišnasp does help in anything only one guy Justi, Namenbuch, in  282 mentions about Wišnasp with less than 10 word and not even details. So we believe in that just because Iranica says so? I personally don''t see any logical trace between.  I remember reading this even back in india how come muzzafudin said when Arabs came we were not aware of Arabs or Islam our forefathers accepted Islam and blessed by khlifa Ali?  The Shansbani might of knew about their root and if they were persian or any ruling dynasty related to persia they would take pride and condamn the Arabs like the parsis of india. One sure thing I know that suri by their own word were the first muslims of Afghanistan and considered themselves anti-persian. Because the fella called Farsiwan seems to pull out something which I researched. Correct me if I am wrong why did Suri mention in shahnameh killed the last king of Persia and helped spread Islam? Why did khawarzm who won hearts and minds of persian yat hated by sunni population and the hardcore sunni ghurids, who were pan-abbasids?. The most important concept here is that Ghurid were Afghan and perhaps pure and since pashtuns claim it as own nothing wrong with that. Because every pashtun tribe or dynasty one way or other did not give up persian and it was always in their courts. Because of their nature being natives of Khorasan as many iranian intellectuals agree came modern Persian language so what is the problem? 68.171.231.17  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

The point is that we can''t speculate about motives because we don''t do WP:OR. We need to look for external sources to guide us on the veracity of information out there. If we can''t show that a source is unreliable, and the source is reasonable, we should present their statistics with the appropriate caveats.  (sniff out my socks)';0;0;0;0;0;0

After screwing it up a few times, I have done rewrites of parts of the article (mainly a word and a sentence left and right) to make the distinction and relation between the Dutch and the Flemish clearer. The article switched constantly between parts about the Dutch only, and parts about the Dutch and Flemish together. This should now be clearer. The major thing left to adjust are the graphs of the number of Dutch, since these still al include the Flemish.;0;0;0;0;0;0

Lastly, even when the phrase """"state terror"""" is not used, but the article is clearly about the topic, it might be included.

Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin''s cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler''s SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation).

If she had repeatedly proclaimed her Jewishness in her reviews, and had become famous as being a """"Jewish American film critic"""", then that would be important to note in the opening paragraph.  My point about the other critics was not that they are Jewish, but that whether or not they are Christian, Jewish, or otherwise is not even mentioned in the lead paragraphs of their articles.  Why should the Kael entry be any different?  Again, it is already mentioned in the article that her parents were Jewish, so its not like I''m attempting to keep something important from """"public display"""".- Of what relevance, is it then, that she is an """"American film critic""""? Since she doesn''t deal only with American filims. This refers to her being an American. Why is that there? The plain and simple fact is that she is a Jew, religiously and ethnically. If it is so important that she not be labelled as such then we can just leave it out but let''s make your rationale quite clear. -  Well, the relevance of Kael being described as an """"American film critic"""" is because that is exactly why she is/was famous.  It is standard to discuss somebody''s nationality in the lead paragraph of an encyclopedic entry, not their religious beliefs unless that was one of the defining characteristics of their fame.  And Kael was NOT famous for being a Jew, she was famous for being a film critic.  If she was a practicing Jew (and I have no idea if she was or not), she never discussed it in print (as far as I can recall) or in any interviews, and it didn''t seem to be reflected in her critical POV.  Now, if she had repeatedly brought up her ethnicity/religion in her reviews as some kind of critical barometer, I could easily understand why somebody would feel compelled to describe Kael as a """"Jewish film critic"""".  But she didn''t do that.  And again I direct your attention to any of the other film critic articles on wikipedia.  Is Roger Ebert a """"Christian film critic""""?  Andrew Sarris an """"atheist film critic""""?  Not according to wikipedia they''re not.  (I''m using those two as examples...I don''t know or care what, if any, religious background they may have).

47438715457;'List of cities and towns in UtahI appreciate your input on the article. I had recently viewed the article Colorado municipalities, and found the population change section quite interesting. There is certainly other info on that article that is unnecessary, but I do believe that it is useful and interesting information, or at the very least I don''t understand what makes it less relevant than something like elevation or especially median household income. The 2000 census info itself may not be current, but I feel that the growth of the city is relevant to the subject - certainly the growth rate of a city is a useful piece of information? I understand the argument that colored text is not acceptable because of color blindness. I was simply copying what was found in the Colorado municipalities article. I do not know enough about how the tables work to do it in a more acceptable way myself, but I would ask that the population change information allow to be included - if the color of the text were black then I don''t think that information alone would keep it from remaining a featured list.';0;0;0;0;0;0

I think these two pages should be merged, but not know how to but the merge template on page.  Very simple: take the content out of one article, put it in the other, and then turn the former into a redirect to the latter.  | T@lk Pages merged - lists need a lot of work.  Insert non-formatted text here Insert non-formatted text here Insert non-formatted text hereInexplicable text (above line) removed from article page. Does it mean anything?  It''s a newbie test, resulting from clicking the buttons above the edit window.  | T@lk I think that the article hematology should define hematology (as in what a hematologist does), not blood diseases.  We should create that article separately.  I think that haematologist and haematology should remain separate pages.  They are not the same.  It is easy to click on a link to look up haematologist on the haematology page.  I disagree. Being a hematologist is practicing hematology. Hematology is not just the diseases but just as much diagnostics, epidemiology and laboratory medicine. Together with gastroenterology it is one of the few fields that has retained its own diagnostic process (no need to send the blood film to a dedicated expert). I''d suggest moving the diseases to a seperate page and using this page to mention the main ones (red cells, white cells, transfusion and coagulation).  | T@lk SPELLING!Can we please have this page retitled as hematology. It is NOT spelt hematology, sorry if american people think it is spelt like that. But ARGGGHHH, doctors were around in england long before america, the language was born here, spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid -  regards  .I think there is room in the world for both spellings as all things evolve differently in different locations. Including language and it''s details. Since when were doctors in England before America? Native Americans practiced medicine. And if you refer to doctors as practitioners of modern Western medicine, remember that at the time America became a country, doctors were still trying to save people by bleeding them. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 67.173.46.246  . There is a redirect from haematology to hematology, so we English will find the page.  The page was at Haematology until  changed it to Hematology in an edit on the 5th of November, 2004, apparently in order to """"keep the American spelling into Wikipedia"""". According to Wikipedia policy, it should have stayed at Haematology (there is no preference for US English in Wikipedia), but it has been at the (admittedly awful) title of """"Hematology"""" for so long, trying to get it restored may be something of a fruitless exercise.

The object is not just to give an account of legends, but to describe the state of knowledge on this deity. The Winnebago describe him as a man, but in a very broad sense, like the Norse mann, which denotes not only mortal humans, but members of various divine races. Given that English is a little more restrictive in this way, I don''t advise """"man"""" in the parenthetical part of the title. """"Deity"""" is probably safe enough when broadly construed. He is at least a supernatural being. He is not found in Algonquian sources, nor in Caddoan. One can adduce by argument other cognates all of which are from Siouan tribes.

85527198651;', 23 August 2013 (UTC)Here''s what I find interesting about this thread. The structure of Wikipedia enables anyone to edit and source articles.  So, if someone feels something is missing from an article, they are free to edit in and source what they believe is missing.  Then, of course, their own edits are open to a challenge.  All I''ve seen here, and elsewhere are complaints and tagging about POV.  After a while, this is repetitive and just not productive. And of course, none of us work for anyone else at Wikipedia, no one gets to boss anyone around or intimidate anyone into writing for them.  No one here can force anyone else here to obey their will. If you have the courage of your convictions, write it and source it . Put up or shut up.  11:21';0;0;0;0;0;0

43735972747;Help clarify an artice: John Stark I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)Thanks,;0;0;0;0;0;0

(Why hasn''t he been similarly blocked for 3RR or is it just one rule for one and another for those with friends in Wikimadmin? I added a fully policy-correct entry only to have TheOldJacobite arbitrarily remove it - and HE HAS (according to his discipline record) done this before. I, on the other hand, was simply adding a notable entry in accordance with what was required ... And yes I did read the WP:SONGCOVER. However, TheOldJacobite seems to think he owns this page and did everything to feed me incorrect information about policy - I checked and confirmed that he was making up clauses of policy that simply did not exist - and then tried to have me blocked and the page locked, a decision which Mark Arsten did not uphold. I''d like this matter now referred to Mark and an impartial review of the edit made again, as it would seem that your own blocking of my account on this is very one-sided and is, in itself, an arbitrary decision that needs to be referred to a higher authority within the Foundation. David Biddulph''s referral for blocking is highly skewed as it does not include the background reasons for me having to protect my edit from the continual vandalistic behaviour of TheOldJacobite or Sjo. He, not surprisingly, skews the request by only mentioning 3RR and not requesting an impartial review of the entire matter. If that had been done properly, as per Wiki edit-warring policy, then a sanction against both parties should have been enforced.It is no wonder that new editors are leaving Wikipedia in droves when they are treated as inferior contributors and those editors who have a rather chequered past - TheOldJacobite''s general behaviour is logged as public information - seems to be ignored as if their arbitrary an non-policy deletions are sacrosanct.I wonder if we''ll see the matter referred to Mark Arsten as requested, or whether the appeal process is simply ignored. As this is a formal appeal, I understand that I can request the matter to be reviewed by another admin who did effect the block. Therefore please ask Mark Arsten to review the entire matter. Thank you.P.S. As the matter of taking on three editors, sometimes it takes people like me to stand up to gangs of bullies who are all simply taking personal actions against a newbie and wholly contradicting the very policies that they purport to uphold.

The Republic of Central Lithuania was neither formed because of the revolution nor during it. I kindly ask you to explain the connection between the Russian revolution and Central Lithuania before you put back the category. I know that the communist propaganda portrayed the independence of much of Central and Eastern Europe as a consequence of one of Lenin''s speeches in which he gave those states (he did not have influence on whatsoever) a right to secede, though this doesn''t hold the water at all.

54387195664;Re: Mass removal of language articles by Ryulong Hi. I noticed that you reverted my revertion on Kunigami language. Ryulong is indeed acting as a vandal. Without justifiable reason, he is mass-removing content with reliable sources (I found that I have cited 21 unique sources).When we have two competing versions of an article, article with and without much information, it is reasonable to choose the former as a working version. I have never heard of any restrictive policy in Wikipedia: we can add content only if we reach consensus to do so. Quite the opposite. We can freely add content and remove it only if we reach consensus to do so.And actually, the discussion is going on at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Languages#Mass deletion of language articles by Ryulong.

On the other hand, I read the three scanned articles on the quintet.net website (http://www.quintet-net.org/realizations/Concerts/2005-06-17/2005-06-17.html) about that concert. The relevant info from those articles are somehow the following sentences: First article: """"Ein Höhepunkt war die Musikklang—Performance Bridges von Georg Hajdu, bei der Musiker in mehreren europaischen Stadten live via Internet zusammenspielten."""" (""""A climax was the sound—performance Bridges of Georg Hajdu where musicians played together in several European cities live via Internet."""") Second article: """"Surreale Bilder vom Dortmund—Emskanal huschen über die Leinwand von der Musiker Kai Niggemann sitzt. Zielischer drückt er die Tasten seines Laptops und bedient konzentriert die Regler eines Mischpults. Das Experiment beginnt. Die Rede is von der Musikklang—performance """"Bridges"""" von Georg Hajdu, die in Münsters Kunstakademie ihre Uraufführung erlebte.

38481557664;'''Five Moves of Doom'' As a fan of John Cena, I am against the hypocrisy of many of his critics for their ''Five Moves Of Doom'' comments, especially since many of these people support Hogan, Boogeyman, and Batista, all of whom have not the same in-ring skill as Cena. However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn''t want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don''t remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole ''no bias'' attitude since you''re biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

36609613081;"'"" POV I removed:""""Many fewer would have been shot down if not for poor planning and inflexibility by the mission planners of Strategic Air Command. Specifically, SAC ordered B-52s to attack from highly predictable, precisely-timed, repetitive positions and altitudes. This eliminated the element of surprise. The NVA were able to aim their Soviet-built SA-2 Guideline Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) by simple timing and azimuth prediction. Further complicating the situation for the B-52s was the fact that SAC had used the same jamming (electronic countermeasures) techniques for years, thus enabling the NVA to develop counter-countermeasures.SAC ordered the B-52s to make a steep turn after dropping the bombs. This resulted in an interruption in the electronic jamming of NVA radars because the B-52s'' jamming antennas, which were located on the bottom of the aircraft, were then pointed away from the radars. To make matters worse, the turn made the B-52s face into a 100-mph headwind, which slowed their escape. The NVA were surprised at first, but after a few nights of these repetitive tactics, they figured it out. The NVA blasted several B-52s with direct hits. Two were damaged severely and crashed near U-Tapao Royal Thai Air Force Base. The situation would have been even worse for the B-52s if not for the inaccuracy of the SA-2 system and the inexperience and errors of its NVA operators.SAC refused to change its tactics even when shown that the existing tactics were ineffective and highly dangerous to the aircraft and crews. In part, this was due to indecision on the part of SAC''s commander. Also, because of a """"top-down"""" culture which had been originally established for nuclear war by General LeMay refused to listen to the suggestions of its aircrews. The LeMay culture had discouraged open and frank discussion to the point that only """"yes men"""" made it to the top of the SAC organization where, potentially, they might have been able to prod the SAC commander into a change of tactics. (Surprisingly, NVA records and interviews with former SAM operators show exactly the opposite culture. Realistic discussion and innovation were encouraged among the batteries'' commanders.)Ironically, although the NVA had run out of missiles by Day Four of the campaign, and the B-52s could have bombed an undefended Hanoi, SAC was so rattled by its losses that it directed the B-52s to targets outside Hanoi, thus giving the NVA time to reload. After that, B-52 losses mounted again.SAC commanders did their best to suppress revelations about their incompetence, even going so far as to suggest that one of their critics was mentally unstable. SAC has rewritten history in its official account of Linebacker II. This semi-fiction is still taught at the USAF''s Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.""""It lacks NPOV or sources.

95483657617;'(UTC)Actually, most of the romance words in English come from Norman French, abit removed from French (especially modern French). Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there''s a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.I think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).On a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions. But that probably cannot be done. 14:17, 15 July 2007';0;0;0;0;0;0

The Nochiya Tribe article looks good.

I agree with you that it would be good to have an article about the geographic homeland of Assyrians. However, it would be have to be carefully and named. You are right in suggesting the article Kurdistan as a good model, as it has avoided all sorts of attacks by those who suggest that it infringes the sovereignty of other nations. Also, even though modern Assyrians celebrate descent from the ancient Assyrians, we need to keep the articles seperate, as they are talking about two very different historical periods.

Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer-review process. Even if the journal''s referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro-I.D. research, the fear of backlash  even boycotts  directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so.You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we''re dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.With all of this said, the Discovery Institute keeps a page archiving the many pro-I.D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall of orthodoxy that has sullied the peer-review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing.Of course, once the objection that I.D. has no peer-reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will be moved to the claim that, (a) they''re not good enough, (b) there''s not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled """"Answering Objections about Discovery Institute''s Peer-Review Page,"""" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person).Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc., weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance. A couple of articles which come to mind are James A. Shapiro''s Natural Genetic Engineering, which shows that evolution is the programmed result of the brilliantly designed technology located inside the cell, and Michael Sherman''s Universal Genome theory, a view which demonstrates that evolution was a front-loaded event (read: evolution was programmed).""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

35327388759;'Nestorian Church all nestorians in Mesopotamia were Assyrian, that is how it is proven that Chaldean converts were originally ACOE members. that is the biggest lie i have ever heard. And the reason why you think Chaldeans are Assyrians is because of this false statement. I hope you know this that until the 12th century AD the majority of Iraq were Christians, I doubt that only existed of Assyrians do you know why?? Not all Assyrians lived in today''s Iraq, they were spread all around the middle east after the fall of their empire. Many Assyrians fled to the Hakkari mountains (in today''s turkey, and others also fled to other countries like Syria. I find it very hard to believe that even when not half of the Assyrian population lived in Iraq they still could make up the majority of the citizens of Iraq, are you being bribed or something cause you know yourself that a people cant just dissapear, and the Babylonians, never had the time to flee from their empire cause they never had the idea the Medes would backstabb them and allie themeselve with the Persians. Your username is named after your faith, well if you believe so much in your faith open the Bible to Daniel 5: 5-30 and it will prove to you that there was no major batlle between Persia and the Medes against the Babylonians cause they were caught by suprise. You probably thinking what does this have to do with nestorians, well it only proves that no massacres took place when Babylonia was conquered, and that the Babylonians still lived in their ancestors land. Babylon had its province under the Persian empire, Ssanien empire and the Seleucid empire, these were the only empires that took control over the land of the Babylonians until the Muslim invasion, which then the Nestorian Church was established and the Chaldeans were a part of it.Answer me these question, under what empire was the Nestorian Church established??

66702272448;FrankTobia, I am sorry to say, but when you say the debt can be paid off you are, in fact wrong, because of one and only one thing, the application of interest by the federal reserve that is applied to the only money printed and in circulation. So that fact being true in all terms, The debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the Federal Reserve Bank. If the debt were repaid, the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system. Frank, im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book Modern Money Mechanics written in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Bank. Also, if you look at the shareholders of each Fed Bank they will all lead back to the same people, mostly located in Europe. By saying that the federal reserve bank/system does not work for profit, yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way, and im not saying this as an insult, but the only reason of interest to be applied IS to make a PROFIT.

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy''s greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust.

Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It''s a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! NO! Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal!

I agree with you that the Air Canada severe turbulence incident is not worthy of inclusion but I disagree in the case of the landing gear collapse because although there were no injuries the aircraft was written off. I also had no reason to go to the Air Canada page. But the big difference between the Air Canada article and this article is that this Ryanair article is already messed up. If you were to include this incident the next time something happens they will point to this incident as the reason why the new incident should be included even if minor (example: criticism section) Personally I don''t even think that Ryanair flight 296 should be included and it definitely should not have it''s own article. For one, there was no fire (which it says in the main article and flight 296 article) only smoke from the release of oil from the broken bearing. Secondly it was the passengers who opened and tried to exit on the wrong side (not sure how that is Ryanair''s fault that passengers would exit towards the firefighters) Thirdly, the only problem for Ryanair is that some of the staff had trouble opening the doors but still everybody was able to evacuate in 90 seconds. Then in the flight 296 wiki article they even talk about how paying for uniforms and training in eastern Europe had something to do with the incident even though no ref is provided.

In this case, improving articles means adding notable views, especially critical ones.  I do not see how you can oppose this.  By the way, I never mentioned my being an administrator.

64995216910;"'""New Additions and ChangesAfter a long time away from this article waiting for the peer review to be finalized, I''ve returned to work on this article. Just wanted to list some of the additions and changes.The biggest one (IMHO) is the change citations from parenthetical to footnote/bibliography style. Also, the footnotes and bibliography are in a reduced font, done in a style that can be seen in Hugo Chavez. Given that the Chavez article won featured article status, I''m going to take the """"if you can''t beat''em, join''em"""" approach. I got ahold of a decent biography of Suharto that really illuminates Suharto''s pre-presidential years. It''s R.E. Elson''s Suharto: A Political Biography. I plan on making some further additions using this book as a reference.In tandem with the Elson book, I managed to find some halfway decent pictures of him that I believe should be public domain, if not fair use. So now we have a lead photo again! They''re from the Department of Information and State Secretariat of Indonesia. If anyone has a halfway decent knowledge of Indonesian intellectual property law (besides the lack of any enforcement), it''d be very appreciated.For the future, I am looking to fatten up the portion on Suharto''s military career, but eventually it will be exported to its own article (e.g. Military career of Suharto), much in the same way the Civil War and New Order sections got fattened up, exported, then trimmed.After that is done, I hope to do another round of peer review, and then based on that nominating this to Wikipedia:Featured article candidates  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Obviously, the authors of this Wiki found a list of Christians who think Jesus is real, and one Atheist (Ehrman).

There are many notable sources for information on organic gardening... that can be clicked on and looked at as to information for a reff/note. Monetizing the article with the main contributing editors book does not seem like a good idea... especially since the information that it is his book was kept secret... or at least not openly discussed on the talk page until that information was discovered. Mr. Cross has said freely that he mailed copies of his book to his editing team here on this article.

Firstly, I see that they are not as necessary as I once thought. When I inserted them I was not aware of another reference that would do the job I wanted. That no longer seems the case. As has been openly discussed,copies of the book were sent to editors of the article, Skip included, because I enjoyed the cameraderie of collaborative editing - even when there was the occasional tiff. The books were sent out in that spirit. There is another interpretation - that I was in effect """"buying"""" support ... mild bribery. This was not the intention - but then, you only have my word for that. I do not receive any royalties from the book - but then, you only have my word for that too. I do not believe any conventions or rules, Wikipedia or otherwise, have been breached in any way. etc, more text, etc. In short, I am removing the references for everyone''s peace, and to expedite the completion of the article for assessment ... not as an acknowledgement of any kind of malpractice. end partial quote, Granitethighs 04:16, 29 April 2009 .

If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.If the media also doesn''t have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of ''image'' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

91527985674;"'""AdviceTo save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business'' FAQ are particularly useful.Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can''t be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won''t get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That''s more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don''t want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""Regards,   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

47006281845;'To the original topic, Kittybrewster, I realize that this is your topic area of greatest interest, but I''ve been thinking about a good answer, and the best I can come up with is this: we''re both wasting time here. It seems at the end of the day, I''m convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits'' fault, but from my chair, you''re both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.When I was involved with Vintagekits'' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you''re interested in as well outside your original main content.

The name of the god comes from the same root as merchandise, market and mercantile.Still need citation supporting discussion of this point in context.Reference to Caduceus in Homer, Odyssey, V, 47-48William K. Emerson, Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms, University of Oklahoma Press, 1996, pp 181-182""""The Medical Department adopted a 1-inch-high gilt caduceus […] as its insignia in 1902. For the service uniform, officers wore the device in bronze […]. The caduceus, two serpents intertwined on a winged staff, was carried by Mercury, the god of commerce. Shortly after the surgeon general announced the caduceus as the medical symbol, critics said it was not appropriate, even though the caduceus had been used intermittently as various US Army insignia, starting with the chevrons for hospital stewards in 1851. The debate was important because it was apparent to all of the officers that the insignia was to become the device for the expanding Medical Department. The critics were unhappy with the caduceus as the medical insignia, and they stated that the single serpent looped about a staff was properly associated with Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing.""""The Army and Navy Register of 28 June 1902 noted the argument about the appropriate insignia. Giving the badge an unusual interpretation, the editor wrote of the caduceus: """"The rod represents power, the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply dilligence and activity, qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our Medical officers. The design, however, does not lend itself easily to a Corps emblem."""" The dispute over the appropriateness of a caduceus continued for many years but never flared into a raging controversy.[…] [Lengthy quote from old journal here, defending caduceus as a sign of non-combatants used to establish neutrality, and hence appropriate for non-combatants on the field. The article in defense of the caduceus states that it was chosen for neutrality, not medicine, and points out that the majority of the medical corps personnel are not even doctors.]""""The army influence in selecting the caduceus carried over to civilian physicians in the early 20th century, and many civilian medical personnel still use the caduceus as a symbol. Since World War II, many doctors have begun to display the Aesculapian staff. When the U.S. Air Force created a new medical insignia, it adopted the staff of Aesculapius, with a single serpent, as the device for medical personnel.""""A.H. Burkitt, """"On Tradesmen''s Signs of London"""" in: Journal of the British Archaeological Association, Volume 9, London, 1854,  pp 40-59Article discusses tradesmen''s signs in London that have for the most part fallen into disuse. Author discusses signs in use prior to the mid-18th century.""""Of the heathen deities and their attributes we find Mercury, or his caduceus, appropriate in trade, as indicating expedition [travel for the purpose of business]. Esculapius, his Serpent and staff, or his cock, for professors of the healing art […]""""Leslie S. Wilson, The Serpent Symbol in the Ancient Near East, 2001Can''t view this title, but it appears to deal with the putative babylonian origins of the caduceus in one section. Might use to balance against Frothingham/Ward claims.Mark P. O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon, Classical Mythology, 2007""""Some are outraged that the caduceus as a symbol of commerce and even worse should be associated with medicine. (Hermes was also a god of dishonest eloquence and thievery.) Others suggest that Hermes'' caduceus may today be as appropriate an emblem for medicine as the staff of Asclepius. After all, the important business of medicine grows ever more complex, with advertising essential for competitive marketing. So one medical doctor, Glenn W. Geelhoed, poses the dilemma: """"Each of us physicians may choose what the profession should mean, and [between two serpent symbols representing very competitive ideals] adopt a symbol that is appropriate to…"""" [Can''t get page number or rest of quote through Google, page number also needed].Luke Van Orden, MD, Where Have All The Healer''s Gone?: A Doctor''s Recovery Journey, Writers Advantage, 2002, p 129""""The caduceus has been the official emblem of medicine for four centuries or more.

I don''t believe there is a consensus to delete this article, and argued in favor of keeping it, but I acknowledge the argument that it is less of a literal/classic disambiguation page and more of a """"here are some uses of the term which have Wikipedia articles"""" page. I believe there are a number of precedents for that type of page, where a term is discussed in different contexts, some or all of which have individual articles.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

55164404161;"'""I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use """"Province of Lower Silesia"""" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in """"real life"""" the use of """"voivodeship"""" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. """"Voivodeship"""" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.I started a similar discussion in Wikipedia many years ago but I was quickly defeated by people saying that a consensus has been reached and now it''s too late. I wish I was more experienced then and knew that """"voivodeship"""" is against the principles of Wikipedia.   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?

Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?

What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?

Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia''s own written polices, and such.Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It''s against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don''t delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

Many of the other statements on the Walt Disney Company page don’t follow your so-called neutral definition.  Following your own claim of “neutral”, the entire page would have to be deleted per your own standards.  Furthermore, the lawsuit sentence that was placed on it, was exactly as the other statements of “criticism” within the Walt Disney Company page, yet you claim'";0;0;0;0;0;0

3300992243;"'"" Outline of knowledge WikiProject update - 04/02/2009 Hi everyone.Things are going slow again.  Where have you been?!Maybe what you need to get you going is a little competition... Who are we competing with? Encyclopedia Britannica.  Specifically, with its Outline of knowledge (presented in its volume called the Propaedia).  Currently, they''re kicking our asses.  You''ve really got to check out their Outline of Knowledge (available only in the encyclopedia''s paper edition - not the online version).Portals. Informally, of course, just for the fun of it.  There are around 600 portals.  We''re about 100 behind them, with about 500 outlines.  Let''s blow past them and leave ''em in the dust! Confusion in editors at large Now that the country outlines have been moved to the encyclopedia proper (article space), recruiting help on these is of high priority  it will soon be time to alert all relevant editors to the nature and function of these and how they relate to other country coverage on Wikipedia.However, I''ve noticed instances in which editors do not understand the nature and function of outline pages, and complain that they are redundant to articles.  Well, ya.  (That''s the point of an outline - to provide the essentials in a structure for greater understanding, for easy viewing and faster reading, and to provide a topical guide).  A few editors over the years have viewed outlines as redundant to portals, not understanding the purpose and scope of outlines, nor the benefits provided by their structure and standardization.These problems of misunderstanding need to be solved before """"going public"""", to prevent their expansion as the community''s awareness of these pages increases.  Consider the response we''d get now if we announced these pages on the talk pages of 500 WikiProjects, 500 article talk pages, and placed links in 500 see also sections, etc.That could be a nightmare.So... Encyclopedic and administrative support I''ve been working on a couple things that will help alleviate confusion and hopefully reduce the need for editors to ask questions and seek advice.   They''re drafts, still under construction.  Please look these over and jump in and help complete them (directly or by providing feedback):First is an  article draft, intended to replace the current Outline article.Next is a  on the Outline of knowledge and its outline pages.Let me know what you think.  Do they help you understand outlines better and how to develop them on Wikipedia?  What is missing?  How can they be improved?The Transhumanist    ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

2562791652;"'"" Thanks for helping to lift the veil on Verbal - More questions Elonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user''s approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the ''proper'' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal''s standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal''s aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal''s overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He''s not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That''s not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It''s quite clear that he''s an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent. I just believe in being clear, in communicating, and in helping people to learn to be better Wikipedia contributors.""""""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

9157761777;"'""Jorfer''s complaint above is actually deeper than just whether or not 0.999... = 1 .  His issue, rather, is rather the concept of limits actually """"applies"""" to """"real life"""".  He is agreeing that the series (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...) has a limit of 1, but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0.999... should be said to be equal to 1, but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount.The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an """"infinitesimal"""" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.  Since 0.999... and 1 differ by at most an infinitesimal quantity, and the only such quanity in the reals is zero, 1 - 0.999... = 0 and thus 1 = 0.999...  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article. Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin ReformNicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn. This really isn''t a position, I don''t think  he wasn''t hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici...In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn''t make much sense  Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform. Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused. Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I''m not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.  There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg''s had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty . This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions: What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?  Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family)How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights?''''''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.  They, like rich bankers like the Fuggers and Welsers, used their economic sway as much as possible to influence th'";0;0;0;0;0;0

This article is being expanded with material for the first time in years and it''d be easier to keep it separate while its being improved. Clearly the LaRouche movment includes many discrete organizations, many of which have overlapping personnel and aims, and some of which are notable enough on their own for articles. For example, the U.S. Labor Party probably deserves an article because every little political party gets an article. OTOH, the National Democratic Policy Committee, while in some ways equally important, probably doesn''t merit an article and should be covered in one of the other LaRouche articles. Most of the PACs or campaign comittees are covered in the presidental campaign articles, but thousands of other candidates also ran under  LaRouche-affilitiated groups.

They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC) For willmcw I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I''ve interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn''t. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won''t help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you''ve been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It''s a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It''s not a place to gain revenge on someone you don''t like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)I''ve copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC) Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website''s message board he admitted he was falsefying William''s own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose''s appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman''s uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose''s irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion. GreetingsGreetings and welcome to wikipedia.

To quote """"to make the target feel threatened or intimidated, and the outcome may be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to discourage them from editing entirely."""" - which is exactly how I feel.    COI This is my statementWhen I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said """"how would I like to be an associate of the company""""  and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone''s career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI.   Liquid Nitrogen I am sorry, but I do not see your point in removing my edit.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  COIwhatever you think best. I wouldn''t mind, but this """"policy"""" seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don''t have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it''s one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I''m sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit!   Stange Behaviour By Editor McGeddonI am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL''s motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn''t remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it''s probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge.

87836436701;"""== Categories related to the National Audio Theatre Festivals page ==It is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the National Audio Theater Festivals page. I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and """"artists collective"""".  The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a """"collective"""" or amorphous """"group"""" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the """"cherry on the sundae"""". It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an """"audio drama festival"""". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as """"Audio plays"""", """"radio drama"""", """"sound recording,"""" """"sound technology"""", and """"voice acting"""", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories. I therefore have returned most of the categories back. 98.194.237.126  """;0;0;0;0;0;0

For instance:You do understand that Wikipedia has thousands of articles about highly controversial topics? That''s not a sufficient reason for deletion. (talk) That one is removed, (edit conflict, but pretty much agrees with above) The fourth reference is known as a secondary source, which is the kind of sources that wikipedia tries to cite. We take as little as possible from primary sources, and instead use secondary sources, verifiable secondary sources in fact. Google video is not a secondary source, nor is it a verifiable source, so any evidence gleaned from people''s postings there is not permissible as evidence. Unless you can find any verifiable evidence that supports your reasoning, I''m gonna call on Occam''s razor and say that the more simple explanation that fits the facts is true. Please stop trolling this page unless you have cold, hard, verifiable facts that support your thesis, as any further rants will be removed as trolling. Thank you.  That one is modified,This is trolling. Can we please close this, since it is obvious that Gaby de wilde is either unintrested in accepting that the majority don''t buy his/her conspiricy theory, or he/she is trolling.

I don''t want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i''ve been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i''ve had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I''ve seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I''ve been making.

93292531426;"'""I see there are actually a couple of books that pop up on googlebooks dealing specifically with auxiliary do that were published back in the 50''s.  I''m going to attempt an interlibrary loan to see if they''re worth anything as nothing from them seems available online although a few papers in JSTOR and WILEY draw on data from them.  Could be a decent source.I actually did get to read through the ones listed above but none of these are truly """"great"""" sources in my view for the entire topic.  My goal in looking through them was to mainly see if they used the term """"emphatic mood"""" and if so whether they applied it as a means of conveying emphasis and further how they then referenced auxiliary do in this sense.  Aside from the usual issue of no one ever having fully bothered to create a decent consensus on mood as a category and within that a standardized naming scheme for moods, the biggest problem I have with most of these sources is that they seem to assume that non-do expressions of emphatic mood via emphasis of other elements is understood, yet none of them actually include such a statement asserting such.  Mulvey refers to such expression in addition to do via auxiliaries in general with examples of emphatic ''will'', ''be'' and a few others, all established by providing vocal emphasis to those elements.  Beard lists emphatic mood along with a slew of other functions conveyed via auxiliary verbs in general, but doesn''t preclude the emphatic (nor any of the other things he''s listed) from non-auxiliary expression.  Huddleston seems to infer the use of emphasis in conveying emphatic mood by referring to examples that include neither do nor other auxiliaries, but since he doesn''t actually explicitly mark his examples for whatever he is referring to them doing (I suppose he thinks his observations are obvious in each), there''s no concrete way of knowing precisely what he is pointing to.  Google turns up thousands of grammars, ESL primers, and language learning websites that all discuss the use of do in conveying the emphatic mood but again just seem to assume the reader knows that emphasis is the means while (when needed) do is the vehicle.  Their wording seems to again point to some presupposed awareness that stressing the desired element is how you convey the emphatic, usually showing examples with non-verbal elements and then other auxiliaries emphasized before stating that do-support comes into play when no other auxiliary is present.  They also provide zero sources so are worth little more than reference value.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

I am not aware of them being an advocacy group. Perhaps you can source your statement for that. Your personal feelings on their opinions and what you imagine them advocating obviously does not count here. What matters is that they are a notable organization by WP standards (while your neighborhood association probably is not), and therefore their opinion is notable on Wikipedia too. This is in addition to the fact that they''ve been cited by a noteworthy newspaper, The Jewish Press. 2) You haven''t stated why their opinion is not relevant to Goldstone himself. While there has been much criticism of the Goldstone report which has been covered in that article, this criticism is specifically about giving an award to Goldstone himself and rightly relevant to an article about him and the awards he''s received. 3)The point is that there should be balance in the article with a NPOV. I don''t see why the criticism should be incorporated into the rest of the article and not in it''s own section, specially if there is a section dedicated to his praise.   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

85824204849;"'"" == Issue on images still unresolved == I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she''s a woman. Also, I don''t think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it''s a fine line but given that I''ve mentioned it to you, perhaps you''ll take more care to stay on the right side of it?She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don''t know who this other editor and i certainly don''t like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could''ve atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don''t think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn''t become """"controversial"""" just because you don''t share it.Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.I don''t see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don''t feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that''s true, but it''s only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you''re not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won''t believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.I''d urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.If she gets away with this and sets a precedence then I''m afraid there are hordes of copyviolaters straining at the leashes to bomb Wikipedia with copyrighted information.''''I think that''s a bit dramatic but I agree that she has to obey the rules, which exist for good reason, and shouldn''t be given a pass just because she is friends with the arbcom. However, she is not a """"copyviolater"""" trying to destroy Wikipedia. Partly, I think she simply didn''t understand your problem, and that was in part a failure of your communication, and partly she has become too used to having her views echoed by her friends and doesn''t handle disagreement well. So perhaps you could recognise that and be more helpful than combative? I know'";0;0;0;0;0;0

49400797858;(Undent) The other wikipedias dont call it a massacre because their sources do not call it a massacre. Arabic sources overwhelmingly do call it a massacre, and thus, the wiki being a product of its sources, the article is called the gaza massacre. This whole time you have been arguing that arabs shouldnt be calling it a massacre, that the facts dont support such a claim. That opinion, whether valid or not, is not what determines the name of an article, it is what the common name in the language for the event that determines the name. You cannot argue that the 2 wikis are discussing the same event, so to then argue that because of the common name for said event is in your mind, and understandably so, non-neutral that we should then censor that undermines core principles of the wikis. Yes the wiki should server to convey facts and hopefully transfer knowledge, but what we think are facts are almost always perceptions of facts. It boggles my mind that something that should be as trivial as asking what is the common term associated with an event in a given language needs to be so difficult. If arabs are calling this event the gaza massacre, then surprise! the name of the article will be the gaza massacre.;0;0;0;0;0;0

18088053166;"'""Thank you. My problem was with labeling Achilles a """"sexual predator."""" Presumably Sommerstein will go on to identifying Daedaluas as the first aviator and Andromache as the first feminist. Without in any way denying the existence of sexual predation then and now, this particular use of the phrase strikes me as homophobic. It raises the question, which other (nonmurderous) sexual predators he is thinking of? Solon? Socrates? Aeschines? I can only view it as a homophobic remark directed at the Greeks in general. If so, that raises questions about the propriety of repeating it here.To add to that, what information do we have on the respective ages of the two? Am I mistaken or was Troilus described as a boupais? It has been a while since I studied the topic, but I seem to recall he was nineteen when he died, one year short of the magic twenty needed to save Troy. Achilles, on the other hand, was sixteen when he shed his female garb and left with Oedipus to join the battle, I believe. And the killing is said to have happened early in the war. So what can Sommerstein be editorializing about? An adolescent preying upon an adult?On a separate note, I never saw anything claiming that Achilles fell in love with Polyxena at the same time as with Troilus. Everything points to his lying in wait at the Lion fountain expressly to get the boy, not the girl (though it may be significant that she was sacrificed by the Greeks at his tomb).One more thing - when the brothers (which ones?) of Troilus ride - too late - to his rescue, Achilles meets them in Apollo''s temple with an unusual weapon: Troilus'' head, which he is swinging around by the hair. It is such a gory detail, it would be a pity to not include it, I just no longer have the sources.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

152770364943;"'""Penis envyFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, searchFor the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.Contents[hide]    * 1 Freud''s Theory          o 1.1 Criticisms of Freud’s theory                + 1.1.1 Within psychoanalytic circles                + 1.1.2 Feminist criticisms    * 2 Male penis envy    * 3 See also    * 4 References    * 5 External links[edit] Freud''s TheorySigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl''s interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud''s earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.For girls:    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen'";1;0;0;0;0;0

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won''t remove time for worthless people like you again. You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes.

Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that''s your problem. Cos that''s the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don''t even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life. Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It''s only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it''s clear you aren''t a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it''s clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself.

You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.

With that caveat, I''ll answer your two-part question.First, I''m not aware of a book dedicated on the topic of 1988 uprising or even the late 1980s up to the 1990 election. A meaningful book on the topic should in part contain information based on interviews with those involved from all sides, not just based on the account of the exiles. Given that the political climate has just recently improved, I''m sure such a meaningful book is yet to be written. Now, I still think that the military will not fare well even in a more balanced light. (No excuse for killing your own people, and shutting down the education system for a decade. Talk about a lost generation. Talk about cutting the nose to spite the face!)Second, yes, I''ve heard some in the military wanted a Golkar-style arrangement (i.e. institutionalized role of the military in parliament/politics) but I''m not aware of a formal public proposal. I''m not sure if that proposal ever had the support of the top brass of the military. Then again, I can also see DASSK rejecting such an offer in the 1990s. As much as I admire her personal courage and integrity, I always thought she should have been more flexible. She was never a natural politician like her father who was a pragmatic person and actually got things done. Not sure which National Assembly you mean. AFAIK, the military did an about face after the 1990 elections that the elections were not to convene the assembly but to write a new constitution. HTH.';0;0;0;0;0;0

As I''ve explained earlier, the natrual coal synthesis process is a distraction from the idea of NPOV of this article and we can discuss all that later.  And, that has nothing to do with my personal views or opinions.  As mentioned, abiotic oil is rapidly becoming the accepted theory and abiotic coal processes have more recently been discussed and been put forth as theory. That is not the major part of contention in this article, however, and can be adressed at some future time (after the POV is restored to neutral tone). And please, don''t be condecending.  I''ve obviously read the Wikipedia policies and we all know ''exactly'' what YOU are doing with this biased article against clean coal technology. By the way, there you go again with the phrase ''any reputable source'' - in your view, any source that disagrees with your highly biased view must be ''non-reputable.'' Again, you say ''even the coal industry'' ... ''their product'' ... etc. Just look at the way you talk, it''s amazing. The fact is, many people, including those in the ''coal industry'' (as you put it) believe that there are certain disadvantages to using coal in the way it is generally used today. But the hazards that you''re concentrating on with coal, namely so-called anthopogenic climate change and global warming (and related junk science) are not the principle hazards.  Many of the reasons why certain aspects of the combustion are even being discussed (like the idea of CO2 capture) are not because of good science and/or true hazards, but rather scientific ignorance and very bad, very totalitarian policy.  23:03';0;0;0;0;0;0

I tried editing Wikipedia a long time ago and had a terrible experience, and I can''t even remember the protocol since it''s been so long, so I thought it''d be safer to post suggestions here and let someone else who''s more in the know roll with them if they''d like to. The introduction states, """"The prescribing labels of some SSRIs note the possibility of ''intolerable'' discontinuation reactions. Some patients have extreme difficulty discontinuing use of SSRI drugs.""""  Not only are these claims not referenced, but they''re misleading, given that the vast majority of patients, if they experience this syndrome, do not find the reactions intolerable and don''t have """"extreme difficulty"""" discontinuing. The introduction also says studies demonstrate """"statistically and clinically significant indications of difficulties with the discontinuing of SSRIs,"""" thus further espousing the difficulties of discontinuing SSRIs without balancing that with the fact that most people don''t have major problems. In the history section, last paragraph, fluoxetine is said to have """"the highest number of drug dependence reports."""" The WHO site was down when I tried to check the reference, so I don''t know what year that report was from or whether it really says people become dependent on fluoxetine (given that the quoted paragraph above this claim, from WHO, seems to dispute that notion), but to my understanding, it''s generally accepted that people do not become dependent on antidepressants, in the way that the general public thinks of dependence. The controversy section is completely one-sided. Arguments from critics are explained in detail, but the other sides are not. There is no indication that these criticisms are from the minority or have evidence against them.Overall, parts of this article seem misleading to me, and it concerns me because many myths and baseless fear mongering is out there about antidepressants already. People who are depressed deserve to know the facts, and to understand that these drugs are approved because the benefits far outweigh the risks, according to mainstream medicine. This is literally a life-or-death topic and must be handled in an unbiased manner. I''m obviously not arguing for side effects and concerns to be deleted.

95624067799;Punti and Cantonese The term Cantonese is the result of poor transliteration in English. Canton is the English word for both Guangdong (province) and Guangzhou (provincial capital of Guangdong). When the word Canton is made into the English adjective Cantonese, it could mean Guangdongese and Guangzhouese. The language people commonly refer to as Cantonese is in fact Guangzhouese. Taishanese people speak Taishanese, a language that is unintelligible with Guangzhouese. Many Taishan people in China still do not speak or understand Guangzhouese. This is the norm in the whole of China concerning regional spoken languages. It is acceptable to say that Taishanese is one of the Guangdongese languages, but then so is Hakka. The conflict is thus not a conflict between a Cantonese (meaning Guangdongese) speaking people against a non-Cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke Cantonese meaning Guangdongese, be it one spoke Taushanese and the other Hakka. Neither party could also be described as Cantonese (meaning Guangzhouese) speaking people as neither were Guangzhouese speakers at home.If not about language differences, then what was the conflict about? The conflict was simply a conflict of economics. The Hakkas were seen as late comers who stole the show in a declining economy.;0;0;0;0;0;0

91268618649;"""Looking at the editing Histories of Goethena/PropolFor the interested parties that are watching this talk page and article, it would be useful to look at the nature and tone of edits which  and  have done in the last few weeks and judge the loving kindness theyimpart on the Duckworth article, vers the near libelous editing on the Roskam article.This just pointing out """"facts"""" and not in volition of WP:AGF in quoting that policy it says...This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of malice. Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith.So, any honest hearted admin, in light of the John Seigenthaler, Sr Debacle, will notsurely not allow the kind of bias editing that now taking place.  So, in the mean time, and until there is some ruling tendered from higher athority, I will lovingly protect the Roskam article as   and  lovingly protect the Duckworth article from any, and all negative edits, even edits that are well cited, per wikipedia policy, I will do the same for the Roskam article.  Again, I am willing for dialog with other editors regarding good faith edits, but the two editors which I have mentioned above, due again, to their well documented editing histories on the Duckworth and Roskam, I will revert most of what they put up unless those edits conform, IMHO, to Wikipolicy to WP:BLP  WP:NPOV  WP:NPOV#Undue weight.  and finely  WP:SENSE.

63274759804;Hi, the Kart Maliks were based mainly in Herat but they were also from other part of modern Afghanistan and yesterdays persian Khorasan. They claimed themself as descends of the Ghurids. When the Il-Khanatas took the power of the whole iranian plateau they accpeted them as their neighbours so they were able to rule self in Khorasan. Just Samarkand and Bukhara and maybe Merv was under the il-Khanatas while the mst of the plateau were under their own hands, even modern Pakistan.Generally we can say they were a sub-ordinated dynasty..but an indenpendent one unlike other dynasties or nations. I just don´t know who to deal with both because both dynasties were ruling in Greater Iran..;0;0;0;0;0;0

Hawking, from the Chair of Mathematic of Cambridge University.I have already made the necessary steps in order to bring professor Holger Beck Nielsen attention to that matter, and would like to know if anyone feel of doing the same in England.I tried already to suggest this approach above, but it seems that my suggestion was drawned in the tumults of the fights and remained ignored.I will ask you to make a join effort to gather your attention on this particular possibility and think of how each of you can take part in its fullfillment, in the best interest of all parts involved. - Lets work as a team -';0;0;0;0;0;0

The fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions, very likely common within the whole Germanic area, is merely interesting.As for my source, I would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with. Quoting one sentence from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Webbpage, based on some junior civil servants (webb-editors?) personal opinion, is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a Swedish medical study (which actually does''nt support your claim).  Selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality, regardless of the source. Besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of Swedish Finland, you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text? """"Det svenska området omfattar Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. Området är i stora drag oförändrat sedan 1100- och 1200-talet, då högmedeltidens stora bebyggelsevåg förde svenska nybyggare till de obebodda kusttrakterna i Finland"""" (The Swedish area incompasses Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. The area is generally unchanged since the great middle-age migration that carried Swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of Finland).As for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of, it concludes with: """"Flyttning över den (språkgränsen) har förekommit i alla tider, men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid"""" (Movement over the language-border has taken place in all times, but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time).Your comparison to Ireland is interesting and in your mind perhaps even relevant. The Irish situation is however different, e.g. the English occupation actively surpressed the Irish language, culture and heritage. Something similar did not take place in Finland.

I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject''s notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they''re affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn''t related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing that you have created yourself - your Twitter feed, your Facebook or Myspace pages, your website - is considered either a reliable or an independent source for Wikipedia''s purposes.Please note that this is a discussion for deletion, not a speedy deletion. I chose this option because this type of discussion takes seven days to grind its way toward completion, so that gives you seven days to find the independent, reliable third-party sources that Wikipedia requires.Wikipedia also strongly discourages autobiographies: I invite you to read our guidelines on autobiography to find out why.If you have any questions about whether a source is reliable or not, please feel free to write back on my talk page.

A few points to remember:There is nothing to split from the cuisine of Hawaii article.  Splitting occurs when we have too much content and some must be moved elsewhere.  That is not the situation here.  There is nothing to remove from the parent topic.  What was recommended is for an editor to take up the task of expanding the subject, spinning out the topic into a new daughter article.  This involves an editor who is willing and interested to research and write about the cuisine of Native Hawaiian and to give it an expanded scope and treatment in a larger space.  This means expanding what we already have, not moving it to another article and adding more copypaste from other articles.  Writing means, doing the research, reading the books and scholarly papers, and doing the hard work.  It does not mean taking what we already have and duplicating it over and over again.

Since that''s a completely different topic, it makes no sense to talk about ethnic and local cuisine here.  If you don''t know what the cuisine of Native Hawaii entails, then do the research.  It does not mean any food that anyone of Native Hawaiian ethnicity eats.  It has a specific, pre-contact definition and scope.When you copied the content, you also copied the sources without adding the actual references.  As a result,  nobody can easily verify the content.  Of course, I can, since I''m the one that went to the library and found the books and cited them in the original article.  You will have to add each full source to this article, otherwise it will get moved back to draft/sandbox space again.  You can''t just keep copying material without doing the hard work.  You will need to add each single full reference to this article.  Don''t expect others to cleanup after you, especially when other editors did the actual research and footwork you refuse to do.Per the MOS, please do not surround text with multiple images.  Candleabracadabra, you''ve been reminded of this many times now.  Keep this in draft space until you''ve done the necessary work.  This will involve serious research on your part. It will not involve copying and pasting material from already existing articles.   ==';0;0;0;0;0;0

Otherwise I will go to Jimbo Wales and ask that this page be locked AFTER I reinsert the links some fool keeps deleting.1.  In 1992 after four years experience in creating the Marine Corps Intelligence Center, I persuaded the Marine Corps to sponsor an international conference on OSINT.  CIA refused to attend unless it was secret and open only to US citizens.  Admiral Bill Studeman, then Deputy Director of Central Intelligence agreed with my appeal and ordered CIA to attend the event, open to all.  Instead of the usual 150 """"insiders"""" we attracted just over 650, including 15 from Sweden led by Stefan Dedijer, the father of modern business intelligence.2.  I was forced to quit government service in order to keep running the annual event.  The Marine Corps lawyers refused to give me permission for a second one, claiming that the phenomenal success sof the first was due to my insider status.  I have walked away from three retirements to pursue this public service campaign.3.  As soon as Admiral Studeman moved on CIA refused to attend these events and began refering to """"Open Sources.""""  I know these people well.  The FBIS crowd is a mix of grandmothers and young kids that would never cut it in either clandestine operations or all-source analysis (I have served in three of the four directorates).4.  The end result is that over 20 years I was able to attract 750 international speakers, including KGB generals, the director general of the Red Cross, the military advisor to the Secretary General of the UN, and many many othes.  I did not allow vendors to speak, only exhibitthis has been a non-commercial and break-even event over the years.5.  Those people, not me, produced the 30,000 pages of information on all aspects of open source information and open source intelligence (the two are different, something this page does not reflect), all I have been is the host.  The web site is public, free, and hence a public service.  It really surprises and irritates me to find that anyone considers links to the page to be self-promotional.6.  The fact that I have written the seminal articles on OSINT (see www.oss.net/OSINT-S and www.oss.net/OSINT-O) should not interfere with their being acknowledged.  This is like saying that Buckminster Fuller should not have a link from a World Game page to his seminal article on the topic.7.  I find it amusing that links to the NATO documents are accepted but great lengths are gone to in concealing the fact that I wrote the first, provided 85% of the material for the second.  I note that the links to the DIA OSINT Handbook and the Special Operations OSINT Handbook have never survived.Bottom line: this page has been taken over and corrupted by three specific vandal groups:1.  CIA/FBIS light-weights who cannot stand to be shown up2.  Alan Simpson, a world-class fool3.  Well-intentioned but ignorant wikipedia groupies that seem to have decided that for all of my accomplshments (which they have no clue, my personal page reflects less than 25% of what I have done for the public, but I avoid trying to fix that) that anything I put on this page is somehow self-promotional.I have decided to persist on the matter of the specific reference as well as the Forbes ASAP article on Reinventing Intelligence.Wikipedia is now achieving critical mass, but these editing wars are infantile, stupid, and counter-productive.  If anyone wants to have a conference call on this, I will gladly participate.  The REASON there is no international play on this page is because the three vandal groups have totally turned off a community of 7,500 I have trained (who now manage 25,000 practitioners of government open source intelligenceCIA talks to 11 countries, I interact with 90-120 in any given year).  If you as a group want this page to be real, to be truly helpful, to be professional, then you have to shut down the three vandal groups.With best wishes,Robert Steele~~""";0;0;0;0;0;0

As such, my infraction is minor, compared to his massive violation - despite the multiple bans, both arbcom and community, and all the other disruption, he returned as a sock, and has managed to perform several thousand (hundreds of thousands maybe?) of edits as such. If it wasn''t for people like you, and the admins and functionaries (whose names you are trying to hide from the community with these reverts), who seem to have absolutely no capacity for common sense or the common good, that could have been kept to a couple of thousand. No wonder Werieth thought he would chance his arm at a return - he obviously knew what you can achieve if you simply defeat CU and have a few admin mates. With this bizarre attitude that all socks are ebil, the rest of the community pretty much ensures such an attempt has a good chance of success.

89682403330;"'"" 2006 (UTC) Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn''t validate it. You''re starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you''ve implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn''t mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don''t share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you''re trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn''t count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable.

These creatures are not limited to """"Tolkien''s Wilderland"""", and in fact the individuals introduced (Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin & Co., etc.) do NOT live in Wilderland. Wilderland is properly the region east of the Misty Mountains, and Bilbo does not reach it until chapter 6.(2) Furthermore, many of the creatures first encountered in Wilderland (e.g. Men and Dragons) are not unique to Wilderland in Tolkien''s Middle-earth.(3) I''m aware that Middle-earth in not named in the book.

They felt that, as the band were black, this may mean that they would suffer a loss of sales for that issue.

Clinton served as POTUS after the cold war had already ended. This can be confirmed in the wiki article (as well as many, many other reliable sources as well). I request that this article remove and correct this erroneous entry in order to be accurate and correct (an important and very valid Wikipedia motivation). Clinton''s term began in 1993, this is two years after the end of the cold war. The George H.W. Bush BLP should also be edited for the factual entry that GHWB served as POTUS (seeing that this is important and was included in WJC BLP) at the time that the cold war ended. The fact that Clinton had absolutely NOTHING to do with the cold war may or may not be added for clarity on this very important point in American history.

18893159495;'To ERS and others. I think LK''s frustration appears to stem from a personal belief of injustice in that he believes the link to templars.org.uk website is being removed with an inconsistent approach to the Wikipedia policies. This article does contain links to other websites that contain a great deal of unchecked or unverified information and it appears that he seems to want a level playing field. But I have emailed him privately to ask that he puts his position a little more diplomatically and I will the first to edit or scorn any more sarcasm. Equally, having looked at the history of changes, Elonka does need to show some consistency here and apply these hard and fast rules to other links if appropriate. That inconsistency could easily be interpreted as a personal grudge, hence the obvious friction. The question of external links is quite clear in Wikipedias''s policies. If a site offers reliable resource material or is a good point of reference that is relevant to the article, then it can be included in line with those polices. I have briefly read the history section of LK''s link and it does appear to be good information and is also well set out. It is neat, tidy and well formatted. This does perhaps seem curious to LK where some of the other links here have all sorts of advertising pop-ups and ticker-clickers with an obvious advertising and revenue bias. You state that you want proof of the charitable nature of the site but has that also been queried of the other sites that are plastered in adverts? Again, consistency needs to apply to prevent stoking of the fire. I will therefore check the Charities Commission entry for this organisation and see what their accounts say. That will clearly show if the management of the organisation is drawing any financial gain which would put in a clear COI position if added in by him. But, does that totally exclude a site if it still provides good reference material. One could argue that Microsoft''s website should not be referenced from the article on Windows as it is a clear commercial entity. LK has pointed out Elonka''s own entry page, but perhaps not in a very complimentary fashion. On that page she has included links to her own site which does feature an advertisement to her book. So I come back to the level playing field issue. If you want to play referee you have to enforce the rules to both sides or one side will feel rightly peeved. I review and edit history books for a living especially those in this sector of interest and I am particularly noted for the integrity of data and cross-checking references. Elonka has stated that she objects to the link on the basis that it is not reliable, although there is no further detail as to what precisely. Therefore I will offer to read the entire website, especially the history section in detail, and see if there is anything factually incorrect, controversial or just plain stupid. Maybe one solution would be to generate a totally separate article on modern orders. But the fundamental matter is still whether the website is a good reference point. If it is, and the history details concur with published knowledge and this article, then it probably deserves its place.  Maybe even more than some of the other links here that, perhaps, have not been subject to such a review? I don’t know because I haven’t read through those others. To be frank, it is quite silly that so much effort has been expended on this personal battle between the two of them and this debate over one web link. They could both contribute a lot to make this article a potential featured article. Who knows, they might even become best of friends in developing a fantastic article on a subject that we all enjoy. I will help out with proof reading and trying to make some of the writing flow a little better if that''s okay with everyone.';0;0;0;0;0;0

67720944355;Dr. Michael E. Schmidt was the head of a committee of three students who were chosen to select the school mascot and colors. One website suggests that a student parent committee selected Brookwood’s colors and mascott. This is completely untrue. No adults were involved in voting for the school colors or mascott. Adults had suggested the Brookwood Bears and the color of Carolina Blue , but in a 3-0 vote the student committee led by Michael E. Schmidt selected the Bronco and the colors burgandy and gold. The Brookwood school song and fight song were selected by Dr. Michael E. Schmidt and Brookwood’s first band director the late Stewart Hughes. Laura Zieker BHS’ first choir teacher wrote the words to Brookwood’s school song. Both songs were based upon the songs from Tucker High School. Dr. Michael E. Schmidt arranged the first arrangement of Brookwood High School’s fight song. The BHS administration had originally wanted Brookwood’s colors to be Orange and Blue like the Denver Broncos, but the student committee led by a Parkview High School student [ hs senior Dr. Schmidt] rejected those colors because they are the same colors as Brookwood’s rival Parkview High School. [ Both of the two other students on that committe were junior transfers from South Gwinnett HS] The colors chosen were maroon and gold which were based upon the colors of Florida State University. The runner-up choice for Brookwood’s color was Carolina blue. The original Brookwood HS logo/mascott selected by the three student committee was a full bronco surrounded by a horseshoe. The current logo is that of a bronco head. The second choice for the school mascot was a bear.;0;0;0;0;0;0

13628510767;Hi Elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag I have generally seen your own actions as even handed and I would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how Wikipedia works internally I confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and I point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for JWASM I bothered to write for Wikipedia. The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia. You are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject''s importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article''s talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don''t hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject''s notability under Wikipedia guidelines.For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

87936652048;"'"" DMSG again The reference to the DMSG, Deutsche Multiple Sklrose Gesselschaft, is problematic. It''s a primary source. Is it independent? From what? Organizations form as patient organizations, often, but as they develop, they find sources of funding, often from drug companies, and can end up advocating the interests of drug companies instead of their original constituency. This is not any kind of charge against DMSG directly (maybe someone who can search German sources can tell us more), but such a source does not necessarily stack up well against standard secondary sources, and the Medline article is pretty good and balanced. The headline there is telling: """"Endovascular Treatment of Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency Safe, May Provide Benefit in MS."""" Obviously, Dr. Jung was correct, such a claim is overstated, if taken as proven, the study was inadequate for that.There are two parts to this article: the alleged syndrome and a proposed treatment which proceeds from the hypothesis regarding the syndrome. They are separate, and, to some extent, the article confuses them.I can say this about DMSG and CCVI: if I had MS, or someone I loved had MS, I''d be very excited about CVVI and the implications. That is far from saying that I''d jump for invasive surgery, and caution is exactly appropriate. But having MS is no fun, either, and one would think that information about CCVI and the research going on with respect to it would be prominent on the DMSG home page. The link from the article does not go to a specific page about CCVI, it seems that it might be pointing to a video, but I can''t see a translation of that. I was unable to find a page on the DMSG site that justifies the claim in the article. Accordingly, I''ll be removing it.However, I did find on the site a forum post that led me to this: [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180802.php Stanford University Halts CCSVI Treatments After Two Serious Incidents]. Cause for concern, of course. There is [http: //www.examiner.com/x-32750-Lima-Multiple-Sclerosis-Examiner~y2010m1d6-CCSVI-Stanford-University-and-the-University-of-Buffalo CCSVI, Stanford University, University of Buffalo and University of British Columbia], as well, about that Stanford report and more.It''s very important to distinguish between the syndrome hypothesis and any attempted treatment. The problem at Stanford has to do with treatment only.There is a very clear report from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, dated Feb. 9, 2010. This is also a primary source, but should give a more complete view of a patient advocacy group on CCVI.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

The difference between her mugshot photo and the celebrities that you''ve mentioned is that they are CELEBRITIES, and I feel she isn''t a celebrity.  Everyone you mentioned is famous enough AND/OR their crime was (in)famous enough to warrant a mugshot photo.  If the reason of keeping the photo is that it relates to the article, I say that the drunk driving section is overkill.  It''s tabloidism.  Granted, she isn''t completely unknown to the public or unpraised by critics, but the entire drunk driving arrest section should be a blurb.

His first erroneous attempt caused the dynamos to act as a motor/generator combo until the governors were mechanically linked. He wanted the dynamos to work as parallel generators. In the movie, Spencer Tracy distinctly used the term """"bugs"""" for this problem when he first attempted to light up New York City.Granted, this is a movie. But the term """"bug"""" was obviously used during Edison''s invention period for mechanical design issues that needed to be resolved and thus included in the movie. Re-quoting the previous Edison quote - [""""Bugs"""" — as such little faults and difficulties are called].

97375091913;""" POV Tag Vandalism? David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching.2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. Source disputes:1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or """"organization"""").2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.)All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   """;0;0;0;0;0;0

Time is no exception to bias. Every city demolishes structures, so its not notable. One of the authors you list, for example, has controversies cited on Wikipedia for ''misreporting'', hardly a good source.  The stacking of sources with the slant indicated shows merely they are not neutral and contain much bias. They amount to WP:Fancruft and WP:Coatrack.  Wikipedia is not obligated to include editorial bias. Detroit takes in plenty, its $1.1 billion budget with higher population density and higher spending per person than Atlanta show for example that weasel words like ''decline'' and others inserted are inappropriate. An emergency manager is in place to alleviate largess caused in part by public sector union contracts - it shows responsible action by the governor. The comprehensive study shows the city of Detroit is in good shape and the Detroit Free Press reported it. The city of Detroit''s home owner vacancy rate is 2.9%, in line with the national average.  The Detroit Free Press termed it a major population shift which is accurate. Many cities experienced change with suburbanization and freeways. The region is more populous and probably more prosperous than the 1950s. The city has seen multi $ billions in revitalization and it continues, the city serves an entertainment hub, has state of the art facilities, state of the art schools, a major university, casino resorts, a world class corporate center, a wealth of very well kept historic and national landmarks and restorations,  modern freeways, etc., is a partner on regional boards which did not exist in the past.

4614685693;"'""With due respect this dog''s breakfast of an article deserves a POV rampage and a much more exhaustive one than the minor changes made on December 11. Please look over some of the undocumented, irrelevant, and in some cases just plain weird interpretations of Revelation that were removed or edited and suggest which edits should be undone. The article as a whole is unnecessarily repetitive and only a small fraction of it represents the views of modern scholarship (see my comments above under Talk section 11: Everyone''s view).On Thomas Jefferson: Myth America I sympathise with your concern to ''[provide] a useful contrast to the other interpretations in the article'' which generally reflect conservative christian in-fighting about the meaning of the book but tell us very little about Revelation itself. I''m not convinced, however, that to dismiss the work as the incoherent ravings of an early christian """"heretic"""" (Cerinthus) is the best way to do this. A number of scholars have demonstrated that the book follows a clearly marked concentric structure which evidences balanced literary construction, while it has long been acknowledged that Revelation parodies and inverts the imagery of first century roman imperialism and the emperor cult in particular to make it''s point (see eg Steven J Friesen''s recent work in this area: Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John). This hardly supports Jefferson''s view that the work is a meaningless rant but nor does it support the highly subjective perspectives of historicism and futurism which have obviously irritated you. A balanced, well documented historical-critical introduction to the work should, in my opinion, make up the bulk of this article with other conservative christian approaches acknowledged separately in brief, concise fashion. I am quite happy for the Jefferson reference to remain for its whimsical value and tentatively suggest that it could be accompanied by some of the numerous historical warnings by prominent christian leaders and commentators about the danger of misusing the book.I also note that the reference to Mithraic parallels has been re-inserted in the Authorship section. What this has to do with the question of authorship I have no idea. The parallel itself is completely unconvincing and the book from which it is taken is a typical example of an author falling in love with his subject and unnecessarily exaggerating its importance. While I don''t deny that the work, by Payam Nabarz, represents a good layman''s guide to Mithraism the suggested parallel between this quote and Revelation 1:4-20 on page 51 (see Google books for the text) hardly warrants the preface that the two are ''almost identical'' or the overly enthusiastic observation that ''the [similarity of] spirit is abundant... to the extent that the names of Jesus and Mithras could be interchangeable''. These are not the remarks of a careful exegete. It is quite likely that there are echoes of Mithraism, the religion of the roman army, in Revelation, which freely reuses both Jewish and greco-roman mythology in polemical fashion, but this is not one of them. Would anyone object to a re-removal of this paragraph?  """"this... article deserves a POV rampage""""— All I can say to that is read this WP:NPOV.Why not be inclusionist instead of deleting chunks of information you don''t personally agree with? An encylopedia is supposed to present all legitimate views, not stick with just one/the most popular.

Completing a circle, in a sense, if you know what I mean.Thanks, Jim';0;0;0;0;0;0

Of these, only the first is common.And on page 25 A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.The disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive, but they aren''t checked out often either.

68124655674;"'""Time to start final editingThis article now has a wealth of information, more than enough to cover the subject. I suggest we begin to go through a section at a time and tighten up.Is all sourced with recognized reliable sources? A scholarly article in a peer reviewed article may be a more appropriate source than a book review in a church magazine. (For instance, maybe the Lutheran Church parish magazine is not the best place to find scholarly information on Martin Luther? I''m Lutheran, so I can poke at myself for fun.)Is the grammar OK?How is POV?Is it covered in other articles and can be removed or moved to the appropriate article?Evaluate the number and usefulness of some of the citations.I share some (not all) of Blue Tie''s frustrations about the article. Perhaps some fresh editors can read through it for continuity and point out where the article is unclear and where it is too detailed or muddled.Are our sources balanced? Have we used too many or too few apologetic works?Have we strayed into Original Research by using so much from the Journal of Discourses? Do any of the established reliable sources cover this same material? Can we quote from them instead? I don''t know, but think it should be discussed.Blue Tie''s comments about the background section intro have made me evaluate some of what I wrote. I still need to tighten up and give attributions. I might say """"Historians Brooks and Quinn, as well as others, attribute the Mountain Meadows massacre to a number of factors relating to the conditions in the Utah Territory in 1857."""" Both are mentioned in the ref sections for curious readers to check out. The succeeding subsections should point to the exact citations in those sources.We need to be evaluating and clarifying, not expanding. (Yes, this is my opinion and it is never humble.) The article is not coming together, it is becoming unwieldy. I came in to help with citations, so I have little ownership for the earlier content. Perhaps my edits have only added to the confusion. I am trying to remain neutral, but it is easy to get sucked in. Are there tools to use for editing? I have been using a sandbox to do major re-writes, then moving it over. Do we want to take a section at a time somewhere else and cuss and discuss it? I have never worked to create a featured article, so I look for guidance in the best way to proceed.There are basically three of us now editing, and it may be time to step back and let others with a fresh eye work for a while. I know I have miles of articles to go before I sleep. So, I am looking for direction. (and going to work.)  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

Lol, anyways, did I say that leaving Wikipedia just the way it is results in a less informative encyclopedia? I said no such thing! My argument is that the inherent nature of an encyclopedia is that ALL of the information is based on one standard, so the reader doesn''t get confused, and that this inherent nature must be present in Wikipedia as well! It''s like trying to subtract X from Z, and expecting a numerical answer, it just doesn''t mutually comply, and doesn''t work well with an organized, compiled database of informative facts. I agree with you 100% that enhancing your knowledge of dialects is important, but it''s just as important as learning how gum is made, learning more about George Washington, and learning what blood is made of, in a relative sense. And this is EXACTLY why there was an article on American/British spelling differences, just as there are articles for chewing gum, George Washington, and blood, and EXACTLY why I chose to raise this issue on that certain articles Talk Page. That''s what encyclopedias are for, LEARNING, but learning at your OWN careful and deliberate discretion, not someone elses.Ok, sir, my mistake for not checking my facts, but I just assumed, obviously wrongly, that words like """"pedophile"""" are pronounced the same in both British and American dialects, but only because I''ve heard British people pronounce pedophile as """"PED-OH-PHILE"""". So, like a normal intelligent person would do, they would make a claim with a reasonable logic base, and not just personal agenda. And you seem to think that I''ve never heard of that """"ae"""" being merged as one letter, do you seriously take me as a fool? Hope not, beause only a fool and an intellect would raise this issue in the first place, and I am by NO means a fool. Well, I''ve made mistakes in my past, but so has everybody, right? But in the scholastic sense, I am no fool, at all. Anyways, just incase you AGAIN misread what I wrote, I didn''t claim to believe they pronounce it """"PAH-EHD-OH-PHILE"""", I was just giving an example for my statement """"there are words common in both the British and English dialect that in the British dialect aren''t spelled as pronounced"""". I assumed, based on my reasonings in the first sentence of this paragraph, that both the British and Americans pronounce this word, and similar words, identically. According to you, I am false on this, but I do not have much faith in your credibility, so I will have to look deeper into this one. ANYWAYS, the reason I even made this argument is that you rebutted my original statement that read somewhere along the lines of """"generally speaking, English words are pronounced as spelled, letter-by-letter"""" with the fact that the word """"color"""" is spelled """"colour"""" in Britain, yet it is pronounced """"CUH-LIHR"""". O.K., we''re kind of going in circles here, so lets just concentrate on the main issue(s) here. There are many words that have greek or latin prefixes, yet the word itself isn''t related to the meaning of given prefix(es). This is, as far as I know, just coincidence, and unfortunately, partially due to the fact that it''s late and I''m tired, I can''t think of any examples off the top of my head, but you should know some yourself. Actually, I CAN think of them, but I''m too lazy, and it would be quite redundant, for lack of a better term. So therefore, strictly speaking, """"pedophilia"""" is by NO accounts a word for """"foot fetish"""".You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that''s redundant!) as well, but as I''ve CLEARLY stated, this is not so. I agree with you 110% that no one is """"better"""" than the other, but """"better"""" is very subjective and I''m strictly speaking from an objective point of view. O.K., just so we''re on the same page, I''ll reword my argument as best I can, for I am pretty tired, so we can stop going in circles:""""Wikipedia is a database of information, and as a database (and also an encyclopedia), there must be a standard setting, language, consolidation, unification, etc., so that the information is clear, proper, and concise. In order to acheive this unity, there must be a standard for which all other articles are based. It makes no sense not use the dialect that the majority of the English-speaking world uses, and to use one that a minority, regardless of quantitative value, uses. Therefore, since the majority of the English-speaking world uses the so-called """"American-English"""" as the st'";0;0;0;0;0;0

In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaignsDavid Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke''s spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler''s appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of ''Grand Wizard'' to ''National Director'' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others.

Iranian, originally meant the Iranian peoples, which are a number of ethnic groups including the Persian people. The Iranian sate was named after the Iranian people and many dynasty''s that ruled Iran historicly were not ethnically Persinal at all. Despite being known as Iran internally, for it''s entire history, the Greeks refered to the country as Persia, in reference to the country''s most important ethnic group at the time and this name was later adopted by the Roman''s and then used throughotu the West until 1936 when Reza Shah got the Western states to officially recognise the country''s name as Iran.

If you had payed attention, you would have had realised that I actually removed that paragraph, because their Turkic origin is NOT disputed in mainstream sources.  I think that 90% of the people are not interested in their ethnic background, and especially not in their Turkic ethnic background, because they did not rule in the name of Turks, not had they any influence or some other kind of nationalst involvement in the history of the Turkic peoples. Not even Encyclopaedia Britannica (your favourite source) mentions their ethnic background: .  What''s important is that the dynasty was started by a former slave, and that it rose out of the chaos that followed Seljuqid decline in Central Asia. It''s absolutely unimportant whether Anushtigin was a Turk, a Mongol, a Chinese, or a Brazilian, because his descendants ruled as the """"Shahs of Khorezm"""" and not as the """"Turkic rulers of Turkistan"""". If someone is interested in Anushtigin''s background, he can click on the link. The dynasty was certainly not """"Turkic"""", as you claim (and this is indeed bad faith), but only the dynasty''s founder was (most likely) of Qipchaq origin.  In the article Mughals we agreed not to mention any ethnic lables, because the Mongolian origin of the dynasy''s founder has no importance - the Mughals came from a Mongol background, but they were not Mongol rulers (in contrast to their Gengghizid ancestors).  I do not dispute authoritative sources, such as Iranica, who describe Anushtigin as a Turk. That''S why I have modified the Anush Tigin Gharchai article. But I do dispute POV claims that try to """"Turkify"""" a dynasty that was neither Turkic in language, nor in culture or identity.  ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

This should result in a more harmonious and co-operative environment in which DP London can hold conferences in Britain and continue it’s work in highlighting human rights abuses in Bangladesh and help make it a more effective organisation. Please signal your position regarding this communiqué.   -The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns. -An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain. -Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less. -The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka. This means the celebration of British Bangladeshi’s born and bought up in the UK as well, such as Rabina Khan and Abdul Ahad.  -DP to become a genuine human rights organisation. This means concentration on bread and butter issues such as providing clean drinking water, inoculation and freedom from corruption and not 101 blog posts about the Awami League and the upcoming (irrelelevant) elections in Bangladesh. Drishtipat''s greatest disservice to the Bangladeshi Human Rights/NGO sector is that they have made NGO work controversial by making it party-political.

DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan''s PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half. To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject. DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn''t transmitting continuously.As I believe I''ve said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it. That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked. There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT''s dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue.';0;0;0;0;0;0

At best I am only willing to comment on new results, pro or con, when they arrive, here in these talk pages. The order of hypothesis rejection at this point needs to progress from 1) the sedimentary nanodiamonds do not exist, 2) these nanodiamonds are not real 3) the nanodiamonds are not impact nanodiamonds 4) they do not represent impact proxies and 5) there was not an impact at the Younger Dryas boundary.

66476620286;Template:Infobox former monarchy Hi, Thumperward. The reason I reverted your edit is because there are dozens of articles using the template which do not have a specific value for the CoA width parameter, based on the assumption that the default width was 120px. When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.;0;0;0;0;0;0

50171364567;I kinda liked the changes made by anon. But we can consider them later. I collapsed the template.I did check out the article on Kaziranga National Park. I learned something new: the Main article link is indeed useful, but in a very specific circumstance: when there is an article already in existence that directly enlarges the subsection in question. For example, the subsection on Fauna is linked to a larger and more detailed article on the fauna of this national park. Another example is the article on Buckingham Palace. The subsection on The Garden and the Mews has a Main link to an article specifically dealing with the Buckingham Palace garden. In Sustainability, this is not the case, and there is often redundancy: for example, Main link points to acid rain and climate change when in fact that subsection already has those articles embedded in the text. The book is Principles of Sustainability, by Simon Dresner, 2002. The paperback is coming next month, but the hardback should be easy to get thru the library. I took a peek via Amazon, and it looks like most of the book is a very detailed history of the concept. It appears that it was actually the World Council of Churches that originated the term.;0;0;0;0;0;0

42461123910;'Long wave, because of the long wavelength, needs impractically large antennas to broadcast with any reasonable efficiency. The tallest ever man-made structure before the Burj Khalifa was a longwave transmitter: Warsaw radio mast. Its ground wave range is also relatively long compared to medium wave, which means that the transmissions will reach out over a much wider area (1000 km is not unusual). That may sound like an advantage, but at such low frequencies, bandwidth is at a premium, so the longwave band has to be rather small (it''s just over 100 kHz wide in Europe). Combine those two effects, and and what happens is that a single medium-powered transmitter will swamp a very large area, making that frequency unusable to anyone else, and taking away almost 10% of the available frequency space within that wide area. So the longwave band is good purely from a transmission effectiveness point of view (if you ignore lightning interference) but it doesn''t work too well on a economical/commercial level. This is one of the reasons the FM band was moved from 50 MHz to its modern place after WW2: the higher frequencies are much more strongly localised to one area, so there is room for a lot more stations in a given space and stations can cater more easily to smaller, local audiences, which keeps costs down and attracts more people. A longwave transmitter for a single large city is silly, but for VHF it works.';0;0;0;0;0;0

Anti-Semitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge, and Wikipedia should categorically label a person as anti-Semitic only in cases where the person either admits to being anti-Semitic or admits to holding unquestionably anti-Semitic views.  Gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges.  I do, however, sympathize with people who continue to add the ''anti-Semitic People'' tag to his page. I therefore propose the creation of a new category called ''People accused of anti-Semitism''. The category would be for people who face (or have faced) substantiated charges of anti-Semitism from respected sources.  """"Substantiated charges"""" would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge (as opposed to a """"my best friend''s roommate told me"""" accusation), and """"respected sources"""" would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating anti-Semitism (civil rights organizations like ADL and SPLC come to mind).

67076933217;'To start: this cannot be discussed with you. You are topic banned from agricultural chemicals broadly construed. As per the article content, DOW are quite clearly a company who specialise in agricultural chemicals, and RE Bhopal - this was a chemical disaster that involved a chemical mainly used in fertiliser. You are not allowed to edit in this topic area.However for anyone else: coatracking environmental concerns with one company into another companies article is non-neutral editing. Dow and Dupont are not merged yet. Info on past DuPont environmental concerns may be relevant on a combined Dow-Dupont article once the companies merge - I assume at that point someone will either create a new article on the new company, or attempt to merge the Dow-Dupont articles together. From experience and past convention it is likely this would end up as a third article with the Dow & Dupont articles covering the individual histories of the respective companies. Assuming this article is kept as a historical article of Dow prior to the merge, it wouldnt be valid here, would be at DuPont, and would be at an article after the merger.RE Bhopal: The only reason Dow is even relevant is that activists are claiming Dow is responsible for the cleanup once it acquired Carbide many years later. Which is more than covered by the information included currently. Detailed info on the Bhopal disaster is available at the dedicated article and the article for Carbide (who were responsible for the problem).Excessive info included above places undue weight on events that were entirely out of Dow''s control and unrelated to them except very remotely. Its practically a textbook example of an attempt to skew an article to make a company look worse than it actually is.';0;0;0;0;0;0

As the press of 1989 couldn''t find a category to neatly file TRT under they chose the recently created funk metal and FNM just shrugged their shoulders. At the time of release FNM were indifferent to the phrase, like any artist they didn''t want their work to be pigeonholed but it didn''t seem to irk them until the end of 1990 when the term was fired at them in almost every interview. FNM began to loathe this sign that had been hung around their necks and their reaction was to do everything in their creative power to write a forth album that would shove funk metal up the media''s rear end!""""This primary source actually reinforces the impression that the band can be described as funk metal, since it acknowledges how widely that label was applied to the band. So for any editors who prefer primary to WP:SECONDARY sources (Wikipedia prefers secondary sources), the primary sources also tell us that the funk metal genre should be listed in the infobox, as it was so prominent.

To resolve this, I created redirects into the list with verbose titles like R1: Explosive when dry. Template:R-phrase now links to the list via these redirects, and the redirect titles come up on the tooltip. That way, you get your tooltip, and I get web-accessibility. I hope this makes sense to you.If ever you chem guys get around to creating separate articles on each R-phrase (and I think you could, with expanded information on the nature of the hazard, standards for storage, transport and use, and a list of chemicals to which the R-phrase applies), then you can either overwrite the redirect with the article, or retarget the redirect at the article.

But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? My last comment is in response to Chzz''s question about me making the ''gay comment'' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn''t spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...Even if you unblock me (which you won''t... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don''t want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

97808296003;Scarab bug tracking software Yesterday I was reading through Comparison of issue tracking systems and followed the link Scarab.This lead to a disambiguation page. The page listed:An open source bugtracker softwareThis text and the links contained are extremely confusing. The disambiguation template clearly states that if an internal link (such as the one from the comparison) leads to this disambiguation page, you should change that incoming link it to point to the appropriate article. Since the article did not exist and since the item in the list for the application was confusing, I decided to create a Scarab Bug Tracking page.To make things as seamless as possible, I quickly copied the text from the old item into the new article, intending to improve the article as soon as it was created. Before I could make my modifications, you changed the content to link back to the list or something similarly stupid. (I would go back and read exactly what you changed it to, but you deleted the page, so I can’t check the history)After I reverted your changes and then made some minor changes to the content, I put the page up for move proposal to Scarab (software) to be more consistent with pages that are from disambiguation pages.This morning I came back to the page to check if it had moved, but it was gone! I assumed that maybe it was just moved and that the old page no longer existed. I poked around the Move proposal list, and the disambiguation page that I had originally edited (Still in that state) and could no longer find the page.As a person unfamiliar with all Wikipedia bullshit politics and confusing processes, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened to the page I had created less than 24 hours ago. Finally I found it, the person who originally ruined my short article after less than ONE MINUTE of my edit, - you -, deleted it!In your comments, you did not explain the reason for deletion, you only sited “A3”. To anyone but a Wikipedia user extremely familiar with deletion, this would be meaningless. An “article too short” would have been much better. After digging around a lot, I found that it was a reference to the third reason an _A_rticle could be deleted. Hence, the A3. You should AT LEAST link to that so people that aren’t familiar with Wikipedia jargon can figure out what that means without searching through piles and piles of horribly disorganized Wikipedia-politics-ridden pages.Considering that the content I posted stated that it was a stub, the time it takes to delete an article, and the relative ‘freshness’ of the page, it makes you look like a deleting troll. If you thought that the page was clearly grounds for deletion, you should have put that inside the article or something and let it stand for a good 48 hours before finalizing the deletion.I agree that Wikipedia should not be laden with content-free articles, but having cyclic links from the disambiguation page, to the bug tracking software page, and back is worse. If there is no article to link to, there should be no link.The only things that you achieved by deleting the page is: made yourself stand out as a stereotypical Wikipedia troll/nazi/zealot, put off a Wikipedia contributor from continuing to improve the quality of Wikipedia, wasted a lot of my time to investigate what the hell happened to the page I created, and broke at least two internal links.You violated the spirit of Wikipedia and smashed what little hope I still had for the Wikipedia community.

So I think the best way to go would be to start writing articles about the wedding terms. This way you could do each of the terms justice instead of trying to sum them in up in a sentence or two.

My concern is why a vote that basically said """"I don''t know"""" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal''s conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I''m in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I''m looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

Besides being an over-simplification of the complexities of mythology, it is wrong.

63704401652;"'""Hi PaulGiven your previous edits of this article I''m wary of your neutrality here, but here''s what I think about thisThe ''controversy'' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn''t broken into its own subsection  I guess you don''t want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called """"a controversial person"""" and was much different than its current incarnation.The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can''t deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn''t want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.The references to """"Oh Paula"""" probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn''t reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.I''m sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are- Coulter wanting to """"bring down the president"""", no matter the best interests of her client/advisee - Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her """"trailer trash"""")Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I''m sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn''t give Coulter nearly enough credit.Though it doesn''t matter for this section, you might see that the """"trailer-park trash"""" comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

I can understand the concern, but let me tell you my experience about reading this marvelous article.  Moni, you really are courageous for taking this article on.  I stopped reading it as an editor, and couldn''t stop.  It felt like I was reading a story, one that captivated me, and as is often the case when I''m reading a story with a lot of players in it, I did forget who everyone was.  However, I was okay with that because that''s often my experience when dealing with a large cast of characters.  I forget the details, like who did what and when and to whom, but I either go back and fill in what I''ve missed or forgotten about, or I was go with the flow and trust that the players are important.  The latter is what happened as I read this article.So this is my long-winded way of saying that perhaps forgetting the cast is part and parcel of the fact that so many people are involved.  Everyone''s story is important, and you had to pick and choose what to include here.  I don''t think it''s something you should concern yourself about, since I''m not sure there''s much you could do to remedy the situation, anyway.  And I''m so sure that you should.

It''s disappointing and somewhat surprising that such a significant change has attracted so little comment. Perhaps what we really need here in the long term is a clearer practical distinction between the terms ''country'' and ''sovereign state''.

26391084857;'What an irony? The very policies that are used to protect articles on Wikipedia are been exploited by some editors and nobody at Wikipedia can do anything. Nobody has any rights to stop editors who go on a rampage over an article just because of some pov of theirs, using the very policies of Wikipedia used to protect articles. I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor''s articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing.Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.Anyway still it is a huge effort by Wikipedia to maintain such a huge collection of articles, it does not matter if a few articles get deleted or vandalised or removed from Wikipedia just because some pov of some editors. I understand to gain something one has to loose something. It is perfectly alright for all administrators and other authorities not to do anything and watch an article getting ripped of part by part.

96828696288;', 23 September 2012 (UTC)I just wanted to say that professional doctors in Brazil often use it along traditional Western health care (generally after, prescribing together with allopathic treatment, NEVER as medicine). There is an idea here of people of using it in the same way a vaccine could do good i.e. that thing I mentioned earlier with my experience, a really great quantity (in terms of homoeopathy, that is nearly nothing – that former doctor of mine explained the most common homoeopathy to my mother using the joke of the comparison to seawater) of dead ill-bearing beings together with herbal medicine. But I think no sane person would qualify it as cure anywhere, even in the limited demographics that homoeopathy, to say, can improve 5-20% of their immune system functioning (but all immune systems are different because every human is a universe, perhaps in most people something so light that is reason of mockery such as hpthy is likely worthless). Alternative medicine approach is not something to trust (much less alone) in case of death-threatening diseases – in the immune system example, homoeopathy would be used in light to mid allergies such as the source of my rhinitis, with a grain of salt in more serious conditions (together with traditional treatment – like what cured me from chronic sinusitis and otitis, and I attribute it more to the non-homoeopathic treatment), but I don''t expect an effect at all with auto-immune conditions. If someone offers it as medicine, it is obviously quackery, but I think that the point of Mkweise is not how homoeopathy can kill by the ignorance of some users and/or shamelessness of quackers, but how it is said to not work in every situation, with nobody, and all scientific research adequately using methods of demonstrating it, what millions of people that are not necessarily ignorant (including 3 former doctors that saved my life that hadn''t no profit with the so-called quackery) would disagree to. BUT I don''t have sources to reivindicate my claims unlike the other side, so I will neither change content nor ask someone to do it.   22:10';0;0;0;0;0;0

I suggest you consider the quotations (Minsky, Kozen, Cannon) that I presented above. I may work on the state article to bring some of the various definitions out into the open. The next time I get to the library I will explore your references. You may see a bit of movement of bibliographic/references stuff around as I explore more. wvbailey';0;0;0;0;0;0

3601094504;'Academic writings tend to offer a broad spectrum of views on any issue, particularly when it comes to journals which are concerned with the quality of justification for a viewpoint rather than how correct it may be in practice. In either case, an academic critique of the law is not the law as it stands today and it is incorrect to state that duress is at this time (although it may be reclassified so in the future) a justification, when plainly in jugements such as most recently in R v Hasan and in R v Wilson that duress is refered too expressly as an excuse.In case it should interest you, obiter statements in the recent case of R v Wilson (2007) appear to be expressing the appeal court''s displeasure with the hard line taken in Hasan and may well be the basis for some future appeal which might provide yet more clarity.I remain resolute that the wording ''excuse'' as it is used in ratio decidendi, should be correct term applied in the article, rather than ''justification'' which while there may be an arguement for is not the terminology being applied in practiced law today.';0;0;0;0;0;0

78752506446;"'""The simple answer is...Mostly Southern (call it 80/20), but with some Midwestern traits. For example, Kentucky''s hilly topography with many streams and rivers are typical of the South, but the """"United We Stand Divided We Fall"""" motto is totally opposite of most """"State''s rights"""" mottos in the South.  Economically we area somewhere in between, having a better economy and population growth than most Midwestern states, but still behind true sunbelt states like Georgia, Tennessee or the Carolinas. Food and accent wise we are definatly southern.As For Louisville,I think that the """"old stock"""" native Louisvillians are  midwestern in accent and attitude, but Jefferson''s County nearly doubled it''s population from 1940-1960 with people mostly from south central and western Kentucky which really altered the culture. Econmoically, Louisville today has less of a heavy industry based economy  city than it use to be, but instead has employment concentrated in a few """"high tech"""" automobile factories and in the service industry, making it less Cincinnati and more like Nashville. , April 20.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

56555164962;"'""Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the """"Personal life"""" section of his dad''s article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon). The alternative would be to create a stub article which basically has just one or two lines of text, including a link tothe Legion (demon). This would give people the option of expanding it later on if they so desired. thanks  —   ""'";0;0;0;0;0;0

A possible source of information is the six annual reports for the Premier''s Climate Change Council which can be downloaded from the DEWNR website.  Just paste “Premier''s Climate Change Council’ into the search box on the home page.  Secondly, with respect to the “Membership” section, content explaining from what sectors of the community the members are sourced from should be added.  Also, the “dot point” lists should be converted into a paragraph of names in alphabetical order with the words “(chair)” after the person who currently has this responsibility.

Then Christian Death turned it upside down.HistoryOfficially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke upSinger Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99'' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor';0;0;0;0;0;0

However, Beginning in 2008 for FIVB competitions, and beginning in the 2011-2012 for USAV competitions, two liberos are allowed per team, although only one may play at a time.  In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htmUSAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.

Honestly, their all Chinese American. People that are debating on whether someone is taiwanese american really need to drop the debate. It''s in nobody''s interest for Taiwan to be completely independent and even the ROC politicians know that. Drop the Taiwan / Chinese debate please.""'";0;0;0;0;0;0
85761329676;'Hi There  This message is for you and not the Troll. I have to leave it here because although he is a Troll he at least does not hide behind a protected user page. My master (you know him who we cannot mention) wants you to know that he is now editing pages, many of them. He is making small seemingly innocent edits that are totally inaccurate but cannot be easily found by bots. Have fun looking for them. Another thing he will be doing when he tires of that game is reverting the Troll''s edits and perhaps yours as well. He know that they usually get reverted quickly but there is a certain satisfaction knowing that it takes you several editors to get one of your edits it.
